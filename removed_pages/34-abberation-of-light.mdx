Chapter 32 - The TYCHOS Great Year (TGY) — 25344 solar years of 365.22057 days
==============================================================================

We shall now see how, just by implementing a slightly shorter year-count of **365.22057** “days”, we may ensure the optimal synchrony between Sun and Earth over a full Great Year of 25344 solar years. Since Earth moves “Westwards” around its PVP orbit by 30° every 2112 years, we should ideally “meet up” with the Sun at the completion of each 2112-year period.

Of course this implies that, every 2112 years, the Sun will be regularly drifting from one zodiacal sign to the next. However, in such way, by optimizing the secular Sun-Earth orbital orientations, we will ensure the secular stability (vis-à-vis our civil calendar’s year count) of our earthly seasons throughout future times. This, you may agree, is a most desirable thing for reasons which should become gradually more evident as we go along.

My next graphic illustrates what the ideally-tuned TYCHOS Great Year would look like. It is a perfect, synchronous pattern — of a most harmonious nature — which we may achieve by implementing my day value for the year count, since this would make the Sun correctly precess along with Earth by 30° every 2112 years.

My next graphic shows what a shambles a Great Year would be if we chose to retain our current Gregorian 365.24219-day year count. It should be evident what a disaster this would be for observational astronomers, or for any future chance of building upon the good records kept by countless civilian astronomers throughout the centuries.

As one may well imagine, the Gregorian calendar’s proposed year count of 365.24219 days will, over the long term, generate dire confusion and bewilderment among this world’s scientific community. My above graphic illustrates just how the Sun will keep slipping out of synch with Earth over time. Imaginably, this will cause even more perplexity and anguish for our world’s observatories, since the equinoctial precession rate (vis-à-vis the Sun and the stars) will appear to wildly fluctuate in the coming millennia. Ultimately, our system would be flipped upside down in relation to the stars — along with the seasons familiar to the inhabitants of our two hemispheres. (Incidentally, 93% of our world’s population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas only 7% lives in the Southern Hemisphere. _See: [brilliantmaps.com/human-hemisphere](http://brilliantmaps.com/human-hemisphere)_

One may envision that the Gregorian calendar was probably devised to compensate for Earth’s 1-mph motion as it attempted to keep the Earth-Sun axis oriented as long as possible (see positions 0,1, and 2) towards the same star region. In the long run, of course, this is not a sustainable way of dealing with Earth’s progression around its PVP orbit.

### Fine-Tuning of the TYCHOS Great Year

For clarity and simplicity’s sake, I have been using earlier in the book the “round” year count of 365.25 days for my wider Great Year computations (the relative ratios of the various planetary periods have nonetheless been respected)\*. However, since the Gregorian count is more precisely 365.24219 days and since my proposed Tychos Optimal year count is 365.22057 days, it is best to perform some fine tuning for a more accurate estimate of the duration of a TYCHOS Great Year.

A Gregorian Great Year of 25344 solar revolutions (of 365.24219 days each) will add up to 25344 X 365.24219 ≈ 9,256,698 days.

A TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 solar revolutions (of 365.22057 days each) will add up to 25344 X 365.22057 ≈ **9,256,150 days.**

The difference being 9,256,698 – 9,256,150 = 548 days (or just about 1.5 solar revolutions — _i.e.;_ years).

Note that these 1.5 solar revolutions reflect the fact that, if we should keep using the Gregorian calendar count, the Sun will end up on the wrong side of our system (as we saw earlier on). You may now ask, “Will this not cause Earth’s **rotations** to become offset by 1.5 units in relation to the Sun – and thus, in relation to our clocks?” No, and here is why:

Remember that our previous calculations determined that we need to shorten the day-count of our clocks by about 14.0033 ms. Well, 14.0033 ms is about 0.0000162075% of 86,400,000 ms (the number of milliseconds in 24 hours).

If we now multiply 0.0000162075% by the number of days in a TYCHOS Great Year, we see that:

0.0000162075% X 9,256,150 ≈ 150%  
where 100% represents 1 Earthly rotation

Ergo, in one TYCHOS Great Year, the Sun will revolve 1.5 fewer times around Earth (as compared to our current Gregorian year count) – while Earth will rotate 1.5 fewer times around itself. All this with the desirable bonus that our Summers and Winters won’t become inverted!

Note that 365.22057 is 0.00806% less than 365.25. This is to say that, for all research purposes and maximum accuracy, _all_ values submitted earlier in this text concerning the orbital circumferences, sizes and speeds of our system’s celestial bodies (such as in Chapter 17 and Chapter 18) will eventually need to be shortened by this 0.00806% reduction factor.

### About the TYCHOS’ 365.22057-day year length (and its proposed 25344-year-long Great Year)

It is now time to explore the significance of the gap between the integer value 365 and our 365.22057 value. Does the extra amount of 0.22057 actually represent Earth’s 1-mph-motion, thus causing our solar year to be a trifle longer than 365(.0) integer years?

Indeed so it appears, as I will henceforth demonstrate. The difference between 365 and 365.22057 is 0.06043 %. We see that 0.06043% of 25344 (the number of solar revolutions in a TYCHOS Great Year) is **15.3153792**. Think of this value as the angular factor by which the Sun and Earth would be offset, if we were to use a year-count with an integer value of 365(.0) days.

Since the Sun’s orbit (as of the TYCHOS model) is 2.642336 X larger than Earth’s orbit, we shall divide:

0.06043% ÷ 2.642336 = 0.0228699151054219%

However, we know that Earth’s speed is 0.00149326469 % of the Sun’s speed, hence:

0.0228699151054219 ÷ 0.00149326469 = 15.3153792886 (our “Special Angular Factor”)

Let us now use our Special Angular Factor along with our 0.06043% value to demonstrate the exactitude of the 25344-year-long TYCHOS Great Year. We see that 0.06043% of 360° amounts to 0.217548°.

360° / 0.217548° ≈ 1654.807214959457°

and the above

**X 15.3153792886 = 25344**

Moreover, we see that 0.06043 % of 1,296,000” (also a full circle) amounts to 783.1728”. If we now divide this by our Special Angular Factor we obtain:

783.1728” / 15.3153792886 ≈ **51.136”** Our good’ol ACP!

So there we have it; the extra **0.22057** does indeed appear to reflect Earth’s motion. In other words, the reason why we cannot use an integer value for the day count of each of the 25344 revolutions of the Sun around Earth is, once more, a direct consequence of Earth’s 1-mph-motion.

### The “365.22-day” value — not a TYCHOS model novelty

Am I the first individual on this planet who has arrived, by logical avenues and deductions, to the 365.22-day year count? Apparently not! It appears that this precise value was proposed by some knowledgeable folks many years ago:

> “Do our Science teachers tell us of the genius of the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec astronomical star mapping? That the Maya calculated a solar year to 365.22 days? That their calendar was more accurate than the calendar used in Europe at the time?”

— _[Education](https://www.tychos.info/citation/146C_Chicano-history.htm)_, Chicano History site by Manuel (2003)

> “Our Maya people created the most accurate calendar in the world at the time including the calendar used in Europe. They calculated a solar year to 365.22 days.”

— _[Identity](https://www.tychos.info/citation/146C_Chicano-identity.htm)_, Chicano History site by Manuel (2003)

Moreover, it is also known that Sosigenes of Alexandria had arrived to this exact “365.22-day” value. The great astronomer was brought to Julius Caesar in 46 BCE to help him “overhaul” the Roman calendar and seemingly did a jolly good job:

> “Thus, the wise Sosigenes not just re-introduced the ancient Egyptian solar calendar with its well-known four-year leap day cycle, but also accounted for the secular error of one (leap) day every 128.18 solar years. According to Hipparchus’ wrong calculation of the tropical year that error would have amounted to one day in about 300 years. For it is remarkable that Sosigenes’ tropical calendar (a.k.a. Julian calendar) was kept accurate until approximately 300 CE, as the knowledge of its additional leap-day was being lost again for nearly another 1300 years!”

— p. 8, _[Sirius and precession of the solstice](https://www.tychos.info/citation/146D_Sirius-Precession-of-Solstice.pdf)_ by Uwe Homann (2005)

Alas, Sosigenes’s calendar was then dismissed by the bigwigs behind the 1582 Gregorian calendar reform of Pope Gregory XIII.

> “Then, during the late 16th century work of the 6th century Anglo-Saxon monk, Bede, was submitted to Pope Gregory XIII who accepted the calculations. He made the decision to issue a more accurate calendar that ultimately was accepted and proclaimed that Sosigenes had made a mistake in calculating each year as 365.22 days (the devil is all in the detail here); he was advised that each year was in fact 365.2422 days long. There was an error amounting to 0.78 days per 100 years.”

— _[Chairman’s Report August 2001](https://www.tychos.info/citation/146E_Solly-Longest-Day.htm)_ by Bob Solly for The Sole Society (2001)

There was no error in Sosigenes’s calculations. Yet how exactly he arrived to this correct reckoning of the year’s duration is, to my knowledge, not described in any existing astronomy literature. In any case, my proposed ideal 365.22 value is, apparently, nothing new. As far as I know, I arrived at this value via wholly different avenues than those of Sosigenes or the ancient Mayas. One may reasonably conclude that so long as any cogent cosmic studies rely on empirical and observational facts, concurrent conclusions will eventually be reached, even centuries apart!
