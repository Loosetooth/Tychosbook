**EARTH** orbital Ø: 113,230,656 Mkm (the “PVP” orbit)  
Orbital circumference : 355,724,597 km  
Diameter at equator: 12,756.3 km  
Equatorial circumference: 40,075 km  
Orbital speed: 1.601169 km/h or 0.000444 km/s (or 0.00149326% of the Sun’s orbital speed)  
Rotational period : 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds (or 23.9345 h)  
Rotational speed: 1,676 km/h (i.e. 40,075Km + 38.428 Km / 23.9345 h)  
Earth moves by 38.428 km each day and by 14035.84 km each year.  
Earth “covers 1 arcsecond” of its orbit every 7.1425 days during which it covers 274.47 km  
274.47km is 0.00007716% of 355,724,597km (the circumference of Earth’s PVP orbit)  
and in fact, 0.00007716% of 1,296,000 arcseconds (i.e. 360°) is 1 (or more precisely 0.99999)

Equatorial circumference: 10,920.8 km  
Orbital speed: 3656 km/h (i.e. 29.3 X slower than the Sun’s speed of 107.226 km/h)  
Closest Perigee on record: 356,375 km (Jan 4, 1912)

Rotational speed : 16.7 km/h (ca. 10X faster than Earth’s orbital speed of 1.601169 km/h and ca. 100X slower than Earth’s rotational speed of 1676 km/h)  
The Earth-Moon distance is also approximately 10X Earth’s circumference  
Rotational period (around its axis) : 27.322 days (same as sidereal period of 27.322 days, due to tidal lock)  
In 27.322 days, Earth moves by ca. 1050 km (27.322 X 38.428km).  
Moon’s True Mean Synodic Period (TMSP) : 29.22 days (12 TMSPs : 350.64 days)  
Daily distance covered by the Moon: 87,744 km  
Earth orbit Ø versus Moon orbit Ø : 113,230,656 km / 763,095 km = 148.38343X larger  
Sun is 392.08X further away than the Moon. As it is, 392.08 / 148.38343 = 2.6423 (i.e. the Earth-Sun orbital size difference)

Rotational period (around its axis): ca. 27.3 days (much like the Moon’s 27.322-day rotational / sidereal period)  
1 arcsecond of Sun displacement as viewed from Earth = 725.26 km, or 0.00007716% of 939,943,910 (Sun’s orbit circumf.)
