**NOTE for the online readers of this book**: Before you start reading the 32 chapters of this book, I highly recommend you to open on your laptop the [TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator](https://ts.tychos.space/) and spend some time getting familiar with its functions (some basic tips and instructions can be found in [Chapter 4](https://book.tychos.space/chapters/4-intro-tychos#the-tychosium-3d-simulator) of this book.)

### Notes for the readers of the 1st Edition (2018) of this book 

Since the first release of my TYCHOS book (on March 21, 2018), I have kept on researching on a daily basis - almost 24/7. In these past four years, I have produced another [47 research papers](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS%20Appendix%20folder/), the contents of which have now been integrated into this 2nd Edition.  

Each of these 47 papers contains further evidence and argumentations in support of my proposed TYCHOS model. Nonetheless, I have retained much (or most) of the material published in the 1st Edition; you will therefore find (in this 2nd Edition) some passages that you are already familiar with - but I hope this won't spoil your reading pleasure. After all, our Solar System hasn't changed much since 2018! 

Some readers of the 1st Edition may also wonder about a few passages that have been redacted / or even removed from the 2nd Edition. For instance, you won't find anymore my proposed correction of the Gregorian calendar's solar year count (from 365.24219days to 365.22057 days). Let me explain the reasons for my cautionary removal of this part of the 1st Edition: back in the days (2012-2016), I was using for my calculations the now defunct "Neave planetarium". I had verified its agreement with other online planetariums and assorted ephemeride catalogs (over a few thousand years) and was, at the time, satisfied with its accuracy. All of a sudden though (around 2016 or so), the online [Neave planetarium](http://www.neave.com/planetarium) was closed down and, oddly enough, its URL is now re-directed to the famous "Stellarium" (which is regarded today as the N°1, most accurate simulator of our cosmos). 

Now, it turns out that the latest 2021 version of the Stellarium simulator (v0.21.3) is in much better agreement with the Tychosium simulator over very long time spans (only 35 days "off" in 25344 years, rather than the ca. 550-day discrepancy with the Neave planetarium). Moreover, having fine-tuned the Tychosium in later years, it now turns out to be in almost perfect agreement with its'direct rival' (so-to-speak), namely the "JS Orrery" simulator. Its astonishing agreement with the Tychosium simulator (over thousands of years) is illustrated at the end of Chapter 19.              

In any event, the core principles of the TYCHOS model are not reliant on any all-round, perfect concordance with the various SSS's (Solar System Simulators) to be found on the internets - since they all disagree with each other to some degree. What matters is that the Tychosium 3D simulator has the Sun and Earth "correctly synched" throughout the ages, meaning that the Sun will - for instance - always be highest in our (Northern hemisphere) skies on June 21 and, of course, highest in our (Southern hemisphere) skies on December 21.
