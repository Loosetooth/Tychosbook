**I hereby present the TYCHOS model, the only existing configuration of our “solar system” fully consistent with astronomical observation, physical reality and sheer logic. Earth orbits in the middle of the Sun-Mars binary system, moving at the tranquil pace of 1 mph. It completes one orbit in 25344 years – a period commonly known as “the precession of the equinoxes”.**

The TYCHOS is a revised model of our solar system. Its basic orbital configuration is based on the semi-Tychonic model as defined by Longomontanus in his _Astronomia Danica_ (1622), a monumental work regarded as Tycho Brahe’s “testament”. Although the semi-Tychonic and the TYCHOS models are geometrically similar, they distinctly differ in that the latter assigns an orbit to Earth – whereas the former considers Earth as a motionless (albeit diurnally-rotating) planet.

The TYCHOS submits that the Sun and Mars (whose orbits, in the semi-Tychonic model, intersect) are in fact a binary system, much like the vast majority of our surrounding star systems. It is noted for pertinent comparison that the Sirius binary system is composed of two bodies (Sirius A and Sirius B) whose observed, highly unequal diameters are, proportionally-speaking, virtually identical to those of the Sun and Mars. In the TYCHOS, Earth is located at / near the barycenter of our Sun-Mars binary duo; it rotates around its axis once daily and revolves at about 1 mph around its circular Polaris-Vega-Polaris (PVP) orbit once every 25344 solar years. Polaris and Vega are the two most notable Northern stars under which Earth transits in the course of its 25344-year journey, commonly-known as the “precession of the equinoxes”.

In the TYCHOS, the Sun and Mars are both escorted by a pair of moons (Mercury & Venus and Phobos & Deimos, respectively) which are all tidally locked to their respective hosts – much as our own Moon is tidally locked to Earth. Another common trait of these five moons is their exceptionally slow rotational speeds (around their axes). Moreover – and most remarkably – our own Moon’s synodic period is shown to be the greatest common divisor of all of our system’s celestial bodies’ orbital periods. For instance, our Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars exhibit a 1 : 4 : 20 : 25 orbital resonance. In turn, the mean value of this quartet (_i.e._ 12.5) reflects the orbital resonance between our Moon and the Sun (1 : 12.5). This astounding pattern extends to our outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which are respectively synced with our Moon’s orbital synodic period at a 1 : 150 : 375 : 1050 : 2062.5 : 3100 ratio. It should be noted that these exact, multiple orbital resonances only become mathematically apparent when taking into account Earth’s 1-mph motion as posited by the TYCHOS model.

A series of longstanding (yet to this day still unsettled) riddles of astronomy are shown to be effectively resolved by the core principles of the TYCHOS model. Age-old yet extant questions such as the “failed Michelson-Morley experiments”; James Bradley’s “aberration of light”; the “anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion”; the curious 8-shaped analemma (and our need for the “Equation of Time”); why only Mercury and Venus have no moons; why both Mars and the Sun exhibit 79-year cycles; why Earth’s rotation appears to decelerate and its equinoctial precession to accelerate; why our main asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter (and why it even exists) — all find sensible and forthright answers when assessed within the TYCHOS paradigm (and its 1-mph-motion of Earth). Most significantly perhaps, the currently inexplicable so-called _negative_ stellar parallax (exhibited by a good 25% of our stars) as well as the baffling amount of stars registering zero parallax (nearly 50%!) can be shown to be natural corollaries of the TYCHOS’ geometry. In other words, the mysterious existence of three types of stellar parallaxes (positive, negative and zero) is to be fully expected in the TYCHOS model.

Conversely, it is demonstrated that the Copernican-Keplerian model of our solar system cannot possibly represent the physical reality of our cosmos – as it violates some of the most elementary laws of perspective ruling the optical and spatial domain of our human perceptions. Various examples are provided illustrating the inherent absurdity of the current, widely-accepted heliocentric geometry, such as the observed absence of parallax between two relatively proximate bodies (e.g. Earth & Mars – or Earth & our Moon) and the distant stars – as they both supposedly, according to Copernican theory, move laterally by several million kilometers. On the other hand, such apparent aberrations of relative longitudinal perspectives – as well as other incongruities related to seasonal planetary latitudes (i.e celestial declinations) – are shown to be wholly coherent with the geometric configuration, celestial kinematics and relative orbital velocities propounded by the TYCHOS model. In the light of this, the TYCHOS emerges as more than just another alternative interpretation of the vast body of documented astronomical observations of our neighboring cosmos; it is today the _**only**_ existing model of our solar system consistent with empirical experience and the most consolidated realities of our physical world.
