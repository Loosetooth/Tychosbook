Chapter 26 - KAPTEYN'S UNIVERSE - and its subsequent destruction
==================================================


We shall now see how Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn interpreted the "vexing" issue of negative parallax. From the Encyclopaedia Britannica: 

>_"Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, (born Jan. 19, 1851, Barneveld, Neth. — died June 18, 1922, Amsterdam), Dutch astronomer who used photography and statistical methods in determining the motions and distribution of stars. While recording the motions of many stars, he discovered the phenomenon of star streaming — i.e., that the peculiar motions (motions of individual stars relative to the mean motions of their neighbours) of stars are not random but are grouped around two opposite, preferred directions in space."_

On Kapteyn's all-too-terse Wikipedia page we may read this brief summary of his work: _"In 1904, studying the proper motions of stars, Kapteyn reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; **stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions.** In 1906, Kapteyn launched a plan for a major study of the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, using counts of stars in different directions. The plan involved measuring the apparent magnitude, spectral type, radial velocity, and proper motion of stars in 206 zones. This enormous project was the first coordinated statistical analysis in astronomy and involved the cooperation of over forty different observatories."_

I feel compelled to express my warmest gratitude for the stellar work of this brilliant and unassuming man whose lifetime work was ultimately "thrown into the dustbin of history" (much like those of Dayton Miller and Tycho Brahe). If he were still alive today, he would have been my first choice for a "peer-review" of the TYCHOS model - and you will soon understand why. Jacobus Kapteyn is considered as one the world's foremost experts in stellar motions and, in particular, for his exhaustive statistical surveys of the stellar distributions in our cosmos. Under Kapteyn's "Plan of Selected Areas" according to which a number of observatories would coordinate their observational work of selected stellar regions, Kapteyn's astronomical laboratory provided the resources for reduction and analysis of data collected worldwide. His American colleague and friend Frederick H. Seares famously stated that:

**"Kapteyn presented the figure of an astronomer without a telescope. More accurately, all the telescopes of the world were his."**

In other words, Jacobus Kapteyn had to his disposal a unique wealth of observational data - such as no other astronomer of his time could even dream of. So what exactly, you may now rightly wonder, did Kapteyn ultimately conclude - after decades of methodical studies of the stellar motions? Well, quite simply, Kapteyn found that the stars tend to move _in two distinct and diametrically opposed directions_. He called this phenomenon **"Star-Streaming"**.

At the time, Kapteyn's discovery obviously caused great astonishment and controversy among the world's scientific community - but no one (including Kapteyn himself!) had any chance to realize and appreciate the world-shattering significance of his findings.
     
> _**"The well-known Dutch astronomer, Professor Kapteyn, of Groningen, has lately reached the astonishing conclusion that a great part of the visible universe is occupied by two vast streams of stars travelling in opposite directions.**"_ [Astronomy of To-Day - by Cecil G. Dolmage (1910)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28570/28570-h/28570-h.htm)

That's right: "TWO VAST STREAMS OF STARS TRAVELLING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS". 

Here's another book extract documenting Kapteyn's extraordinary findings:

["Kapteyn and Statistical Astronomy" - by Erich Robert Paul](http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1985IAUS..106...25P&db_key=AST&page_ind=6&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_VIEW&classic=YES)

So what could possibly have led Professor Kapteyn to reach such an "astonishing" conclusion based on his extensive statistical surveys of the observed motions of our stars in the skies? And did Kapteyn submit any theory as to precisely why these _"two star streams moving in opposed directions"_ would even exist? Unfortunately not. And as we shall see, his lifetime work was promptly attacked, defamed and 'destroyed' by a shady (yet highly influential) character by the name of Harlow Shapley.

### THE TYCHOS EXPLAINS KAPTEYN'S "STAR STREAMING"  

We shall now see how the TYCHOS model can readily account for Kapteyn's findings. Once again, it has to do with Earth's slow motion around its PVP orbit which, of course, Jacobus Kapteyn was wholly unaware of (since he too was a Copernican 'disciple'). 

My below diagram compares the Copernican model's EXPECTED stellar motions with those EXPECTED by the TYCHOS model:

In short, if stellar precession isn't caused by a clockwise "wobble" of Earth's polar axis - but is caused instead by Earth's clockwise motion around its PVP orbit (which, over just 100 years will have Earth moving along an almost straight line), a Copernican astronomer might conclude that there are two distinct star streams travelling _in opposed directions_. In fact, this is precisely what Jacobus Kapteyn concluded.
