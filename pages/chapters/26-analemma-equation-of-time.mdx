Chapter 26 - KAPTEYN'S UNIVERSE - and its subsequent destruction
==================================================


We shall now see how Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn interpreted the "vexing" issue of negative parallax. From the Encyclopaedia Britannica: 

>_"Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, (born Jan. 19, 1851, Barneveld, Neth. — died June 18, 1922, Amsterdam), Dutch astronomer who used photography and statistical methods in determining the motions and distribution of stars. While recording the motions of many stars, he discovered the phenomenon of star streaming — i.e., that the peculiar motions (motions of individual stars relative to the mean motions of their neighbours) of stars are not random but are grouped around two opposite, preferred directions in space."_

On Kapteyn's all-too-terse Wikipedia page we may read this brief summary of his work: _"In 1904, studying the proper motions of stars, Kapteyn reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; **stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions.** In 1906, Kapteyn launched a plan for a major study of the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, using counts of stars in different directions. The plan involved measuring the apparent magnitude, spectral type, radial velocity, and proper motion of stars in 206 zones. This enormous project was the first coordinated statistical analysis in astronomy and involved the cooperation of over forty different observatories."_

I feel compelled to express my warmest gratitude for the stellar work of this brilliant and unassuming man whose lifetime work was ultimately "thrown into the dustbin of history" (much like those of Dayton Miller and Tycho Brahe). If he were still alive today, he would have been my first choice for a "peer-review" of the TYCHOS model - and you will soon understand why. Jacobus Kapteyn is considered as one the world's foremost experts in stellar motions and, in particular, for his exhaustive statistical surveys of the stellar distributions in our cosmos. Under Kapteyn's "Plan of Selected Areas" according to which a number of observatories would coordinate their observational work of selected stellar regions, Kapteyn's astronomical laboratory provided the resources for reduction and analysis of data collected worldwide. His American colleague and friend Frederick H. Seares famously stated that:

**"Kapteyn presented the figure of an astronomer without a telescope. More accurately, all the telescopes of the world were his."**

In other words, Jacobus Kapteyn had to his disposal a unique wealth of observational data - such as no other astronomer of his time could even dream of. So what exactly, you may now rightly wonder, did Kapteyn ultimately conclude - after decades of methodical studies of the stellar motions? Well, quite simply, Kapteyn found that the stars tend to move _in two distinct and diametrically opposed directions_. He called this phenomenon **"Star-Streaming"**.

At the time, Kapteyn's discovery obviously caused great astonishment and controversy among the world's scientific community - but no one (including Kapteyn himself!) had any chance to realize and appreciate the world-shattering significance of his findings.
     
> _**"The well-known Dutch astronomer, Professor Kapteyn, of Groningen, has lately reached the astonishing conclusion that a great part of the visible universe is occupied by two vast streams of stars travelling in opposite directions.**"_ [Astronomy of To-Day - by Cecil G. Dolmage (1910)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28570/28570-h/28570-h.htm)

That's right: "TWO VAST STREAMS OF STARS TRAVELLING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS". 

Here's another book extract documenting Kapteyn's extraordinary findings:

["Kapteyn and Statistical Astronomy" - by Erich Robert Paul](http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1985IAUS..106...25P&db_key=AST&page_ind=6&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_VIEW&classic=YES)

So what could possibly have led Professor Kapteyn to reach such an "astonishing" conclusion based on his extensive statistical surveys of the observed motions of our stars in the skies? And did Kapteyn submit any theory as to precisely why these _"two star streams moving in opposed directions"_ would even exist? Unfortunately not. And as we shall see, his lifetime work was promptly attacked, defamed and 'destroyed' by a shady (yet highly influential) character by the name of Harlow Shapley.

### THE TYCHOS ELUCIDATES KAPTEYN'S "STAR STREAMING"  

We shall now see how the TYCHOS model can readily account for Kapteyn's findings. Once again, it has to do with Earth's slow motion around its PVP orbit which, of course, Jacobus Kapteyn was wholly unaware of (since he too was a Copernican 'disciple'). 

My below diagram compares the Copernican model's EXPECTED stellar motions with those EXPECTED by the TYCHOS model. This fundamental difference between the Copernican and the TYCHOS model is absolutely essential to understand - so please spend a few minutes assessing this important, comparative graphic:   

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/JIM_JOE_starstreaming_01.jpg)

In short, if stellar precession isn't caused by a clockwise "wobble" of Earth's polar axis - but is caused instead by Earth's clockwise motion around its PVP orbit (which, over just 100 years will have Earth moving along an almost straight line), a Copernican astronomer might conclude that there are two distinct star streams travelling _in opposed directions_. In fact, this is precisely what Jacobus Kapteyn concluded. 

Now, as you may recall, at the end of Chapter 23 I listed a series of quotes from various astronomy literature regarding the estimated "**20km/s** speed of the stars relatively to our Solar System". We also saw that more modern estimates had adjusted this speed to 19.4km/s (or 69840 km/h) and that, by dividing this value by 42633 (our TYCHOS reduction factor) we obtained: 69840 / 42633 ≈ 1.638 km/h (or just about Earth's orbital speed of 1.601669km/h as proposed by the TYCHOS).

Well, here's what we may read in a book titled _"The Legacy of J.C. Kapteyn - studies on Kapteyn and the development of modern astronomy"_ - by P.C. Van Der Kruit and K. Van Berkel: 

> _"Kapteyn continued with the more literal interpretation in constructing his Universe and interpreted the two streams as two systems rotating in opposite directions. The velocity of the two streams would be **around 20 km/s, but in opposite directions.**"_ [Source](https://books.google.it/books?id=AlZtCQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA185&dq=kapteyn%20two%20star%20streams%20opposite%20directions&hl=it&pg=PA340#v=onepage&q=opposite%20directions&f=false)

Wow! We really couldn't wish for any better confirmation of the basic concept illustrated in my above diagram, showing how our JOE and JIM will see the stars moving in opposite directions! Evidently, Kapteyn's statistical analyses of the observed motions of our surrounding stars were "seeing" just what the TYCHOS model proposes. Of course, these "opposed motions of Kapteyn's two Star Streams" were illusory - yet his gargantuan lifetime work (which was ultimately thrown into 'history's dustbin') is now finally vindicated by the TYCHOS model.

We shall now take a brief look at the murky character who is said to have 'put to rest' Kapteyn's Star Streaming theory.   

### HARLOW SHAPLEY - THE 'HANGMAN' OF KAPTEYN'S UNIVERSE

Now, _who_ exactly was this Shapley fellow - whom we may well call "Kapteyn's hangman"? Let's start by reading a few selected extracts from his Wikipedia entry: 

> _"Harlow Shapley (November 2, 1885 – October 20, 1972) was a 20th-century American scientist, head of the Harvard College Observatory (1921–1952), and political activist during the latter New Deal and Fair Deal. (...) He used RR Lyrae stars to correctly estimate the size of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun's position within it by using parallax. (...) Shapley was born on a farm in Nashville, Missouri, to Willis and Sarah (née Stowell) Shapley, and dropped out of school with only the equivalent of a fifth-grade education. After studying at home and covering crime stories as a newspaper reporter, Shapley returned to complete a six-year high school program in only two years, graduating as class valedictorian. In 1907, Shapley went to study journalism at the University of Missouri. When he learned that the opening of the School of Journalism had been postponed for a year, he decided to study the first subject he came across in the course directory. Rejecting Archaeology, which Shapley later explained he couldn't pronounce, he chose the next subject, Astronomy."_ [Harlow Shapley - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley)

Remarkably enough, this budding-journalist-turned-astronomer-by-chance eventually managed to make a name for himself at the highest levels of astronomy. Here he is being received in the Oval Office by none other than President Roosevelt:

(Image caption: _"Members of the Independent Voters Committee of the Arts and Sciences for Roosevelt visit FDR at the White House (October 1944).
From left: Van Wyck Brooks, Hannah Dorner, Jo Davidson, Jan Kiepura, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Gish, Dr. Harlow Shapley)_

In a speech at the American Association of Science in Boston (of which he was the elected president), Shapley was reported to have pronounced the following words: _"Of the five worst enemies of mankind, the 'genius maniac' is the most potent killer"._ Shapley then suggested that _"genius could be controlled by killing off, in infancy, all primates that show any evidence of promise or genius, or even talent"._

This disturbed individual then went on to "disprove" Kapteyn's discoveries by saying, basically, that our Milky Way galaxy is far, far larger than previously believed. At the time, Shapley was assisted by some fellow theoretical astrophysicists who concocted a number of entirely conjectural theories which attempted to explain why some stars are seen to move in the opposite direction of other stars - _'due to their speed differentials around the galactic center'_ (or something to that effect). In fact, it appears that we have to 'thank' Mr Shapley for having further inflated the size of our galaxy - and further 'shrunk the cosmo-philosophical' significance of our Pale Blue Dot' (i.e. Earth). After which, the vexing question of Kapteyn's Star Streaming (which seriously threatened to bring down the entire heliocentric edifice) appears to have been definitively swept under the rug. 

### THE "DESTRUCTION" OF THE NOTION THAT ALL STARS ARE BINARIES

There was, however, an even greater menace looming upon the heliocentric / Copernican world view: namely, the notion that ALL stars are locked in binary systems. As should now be crystal clear to the reader, if it should eventually emerge that ALL stars (without exception) have one or more binary companions, Copernicanism would be toast. As already mentioned in Chapter 3, it was Jacobus Kapteyn who famously stated that...

> _**“...if all stars were binaries there would be no need to invoke ‘dark matter’ in the Universe.”**_

Unsurprisingly perhaps, it was once more that fishy Shapley fellow who led the 'assault' on the ever-growing evidence pointing to the very distinct possibility that all stars are binaries. The circumstances of this other effort by Shapley to salvage heliocentrism are recounted in a book titled _"Analysis of Starlight: Two Centuries of Astronomical Spectroscopy"(1990)_ by John B. Hearnshaw. At the beginning of the 20th century, a heated debate had flared concerning a type of stars that astronomers refer to as "Cepheid variables". From the Wikipedia: _"A Cepheid variable is a type of star that pulsates radially, varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. (...) The number of similar variables grew to several dozen by the end of the 19th century, and they were referred to as a class as Cepheids"._ Now, the problem with these 'radial pulsations' (i.e., Cepheids appear to heftily grow and shrink periodically) is that most Cepheids are believed (by Copernicans) to be hundreds or thousands of light years away. Hence, as the Copernican reasoning goes, this would rule out the possibility of these Cepheids being binary stars periodically eclipsing each other as they revolve around intersecting orbits. This, because it would imply that they move at phenomenal / implausible speeds (even by 'Newtonian standards'). Here's an extract from Hearnshaw's book documenting the fact that it was indeed the unwavering Shapley who first suggested to _"abandon completely"_ the idea that Cepheids were binary stars:
