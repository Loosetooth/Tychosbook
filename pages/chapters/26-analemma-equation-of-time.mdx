Chapter 26 - KAPTEYN'S UNIVERSE - and its subsequent destruction
==================================================


We shall now see how Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn interpreted the "vexing" issue of negative parallax. From the Encyclopaedia Britannica: 

>_"Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, (born Jan. 19, 1851, Barneveld, Neth. — died June 18, 1922, Amsterdam), Dutch astronomer who used photography and statistical methods in determining the motions and distribution of stars. While recording the motions of many stars, he discovered the phenomenon of star streaming — i.e., that the peculiar motions (motions of individual stars relative to the mean motions of their neighbours) of stars are not random but are grouped around two opposite, preferred directions in space."_

On Kapteyn's all-too-terse Wikipedia page we may read this brief summary of his work: _"In 1904, studying the proper motions of stars, Kapteyn reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; **stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions.** In 1906, Kapteyn launched a plan for a major study of the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, using counts of stars in different directions. The plan involved measuring the apparent magnitude, spectral type, radial velocity, and proper motion of stars in 206 zones. This enormous project was the first coordinated statistical analysis in astronomy and involved the cooperation of over forty different observatories."_

I feel compelled to express my warmest gratitude for the stellar work of this brilliant and unassuming man whose lifetime work was ultimately "thrown into the dustbin of history" (much like those of Dayton Miller and Tycho Brahe). Kapteyn is considered as one the world's foremost experts in stellar motions and, in particular, for his unique "statistical" astronomy surveys. Under Kapteyn's "Plan of Selected Areas" according to which a number of observatories would coordinate their observational work of selected stellar regions, Kapteyn's astronomical laboratory provided the resources for reduction and analysis of data collected worldwide. His American colleague and friend Frederick H. Seares famously stated that:

**"Kapteyn presented the figure of an astronomer without a telescope. More accurately, all the telescopes of the world were his."**
