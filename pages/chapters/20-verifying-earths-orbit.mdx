Chapter 20 — Verifying Earth’s proposed orbital diameter
========================================================

At this point, you might be asking if the proposed diameter of Earth’s PVP orbit (113.2 Mkm) is in any way verifiable. Do we have any supportive data or indications that might help corroborate this value? So far, you have only read my position that the 113.2 Mkm figure is based on Earth’s assumed, physical circular motion underneath our slowly alternating North stars.

I will use some well-known relative astronomical distances in order to verify whether they may provide any sort of indications in support of my posited diameter.

_Note: Further on, I will expound on my consideration that the currently accepted distances between the celestial bodies of our own system are essentially correct, while the claimed stellar distances are not._

To begin, please visualize the following dimensions.

First, the difference between Mars’s aphelion and perihelion is calculated:

250 Mkm – 206 Mkm = 44 Mkm

Secondly, the difference between Mars’s (combined) furthest & closest oppositions and the PVP orbit:

157.6Mkm – 113.2 Mkm = 44.4 Mkm

In other words, the known and widely accepted Mars-to-Sun & Mars-to-Earth distances appear to be telling us – by virtue of their observed dimensions – that the unknown value we are looking for (the diameter of Earth’s orbit) can be found to be a very plausible 113.2 Mkm. Here is an illustration to help you visualize the significance of and results of this calculation.

Moreover, with the help of the above graphic, we may now make some further interesting considerations.

Remember: my postulated diameter of the PVP orbit is more precisely 113.2**3** Million kilometers.

If we divide this value by 2, we get:  

113.23 / 2 = **56.615 Mkm**

As we saw earlier on, Mars will transit at its closest distance from Earth – in so-called “opposition” – every 15 or 17 years (see the “79 years of Mars” chart in [Chapter 6](https://www.tychos.info/chapter-6/#79mars)). If we take the five closest Mars transits in 79 years (between the year 1956 and the year 2035) to obtain a mean, here is what we find:

1956 Sep 10

:

56.56 Mkm

1971 Aug 10

:

56.20 Mkm

2003 Aug 28

:

55.76 Mkm

2018 July 27

:

57.59 Mkm

2035 Sep 15

:

56.91 Mkm

**The average closest Mars opposition transit in the above 79-year sample:**

  

283.02 Mkm / 5 = **56.604 Mkm**

This 56.604 value is, you may agree, close to 56.615 Mkm. So why is this significant? Well, it clearly seems to indicate that the closest Mars oppositions occur, on average, “smack in the middle” (within mere thousands of kilometers) of Earth’s 113.23 Mkm-wide PVP orbit. **Mars regularly transits through the secular center of our system.** To a hypothetical observer hovering above our North Pole, this center will only become apparent over the course of 25344 years (or one Great Year).

In other words, if you ask me, “What does Earth circle around? What exactly is at the very center of our system?”, my answer would be: **“Nothing! Except Mars likes to pay it a visit now and then.”** Having said that, it would probably still be correct to state that Earth is located at or near the barycenter of our system. Further study is needed with respect to this particular issue.

### The Wondrous “6” Factor

As we saw in Chapter 6 the average diameter of Mars’s “opposition ring” (157.6 Mkm) reflects the difference between the diameters of the respective orbits of Mars and the Sun.

456.8 Mkm – 299.2 Mkm = 157.6 Mkm.

Note that the difference between Earth’s orbit (113.2 Mkm) and Mars’s “opposition ring” (157.6 Mkm) is approx. 44.4 Mkm. The observed difference between Mars’s closer and further oppositions (56.6Mkm versus 101 Mkm) is also, on average, approximately 44.4 Mkm.

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/076_MARS_Opposition_Ring_02.jpg)

Once more, however, the _very closest_ Mars can get to Earth is about 55.7 Mkm (as it did on August 28, 2003) and the furthest oppositions occur at about 101 Mkm. Thus, one may also say that Mars’s “opposition ring” has a slightly smaller diameter of 156.7 Mkm (55.7 + 101 ≈ 156.7).

Now, if we divide the Sun’s orbital circumference by **6**, we wondrously obtain:

939,943,910km / **6 ≈ 156,657,318 km** (or very nearly 156.7 Mkm).

Ergo, the Sun’s orbital circumference is near-exactly **6** X the diameter of Mars’s “opposition ring”! Our system seems to be resonating “around” very whole numbers.

The Sun covers the distance of 156,657,318 km in **60.875** days which is, in fact, 1/**6th** of 365.25 days.

365.25 / 60.875 = **6**

And this factor reappears in a number of curious ways. As we also saw earlier, our entire solar system rotates by 1° every 70.4 years (70.4 X 360 ≈ 25344 y) and Mars needs 4224 years (_i.e.;_ 704 years X **6**) to complete one “lapping” of its own orbit.

The Sun needs **6 times** as much time to do so:  
4224 X **6** = 25344.

This is confirmed by the empirically-observable fact that Mars’s orbit processes around the system by 12.**27** min. of RA every 36 years.

25344 y = 36 y X 704

This means that Mars’s orbit will process, in one Great Year, by:

12.27 min. X 704 ≈ 8640 min.  
or  
**6** X 1440 min. (_i.e.;_ 6 times our celestial sphere!)

In Chapter 16, we also saw that Mars advances by 2.72° every 32 years. This translates to 9818.18 arcseconds per 32 years, or 306.81 arcseconds **each year**. If we now divide this value by **6**, we obtain:

306.81 / **6** = 51.136

Note that this value is our all-important **Annual Constant of Precession** (henceforth, ACP).

Ergo, Mars’s **procession rate** is exactly **6 X** that of the Sun. But there’s more.

#### Mars vs. Moon

The orbital diameter of Mars (456,800,000km) is almost precisely 600 X the orbital diameter of our Moon (763,095 km):

456,800,000 km / 600 = 761,333.33 km

The difference is only about 1762 km, which is approximately 1/2 of the diameter of the Moon itself (3476 km).

#### Mars vs. Jupiter

One orbit of Mars is completed in two years. One Jupiter orbit is completed in 6X two years (12 years).

Curiously, even Kepler was fascinated by this recurrent hexagonal leitmotiv to be found in nature.

> “’There must be a cause why snowflakes have the shape of a six-cornered starlet,’ Kepler wrote in De nive sexangula. ‘It cannot be chance. Why always six?’”

— [_In retrospect: On the Six-Cornered Snowflake by Philip Ball_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/085A_Kepler-Snowflake.htm) (21 December 2011) for _Nature_ 480, 455

Might a contributing factor also be the total of the internal angles of a hexagon is 720° (2 X 360°) thus reflecting the fact that we live in a binary system ruled by the Sun and Mars, whose circular motions interact at a 2:1 ratio? You may read some interesting things about hexagons in their [Wikipedia entry](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Hexagon.pdf).

We may note that molecular structures also theoretically group up in numbers, and there may be some common principles between the micro and macro worlds, which the TYCHOS system helps to unlock or shed light upon. I will leave the complex topic there for now, with hope that it inspires future research, and continue with the description of our cosmos.

### Venus also supports Earth’s proposed 113.2 Mkm orbit

We shall now see that Venus provides us with further indications, not only in support of our posited 113.2-Mkm-diameter of Earth’s PVP orbit — but also of Venus being a moon of the Sun. Let me describe what exactly my below graphic illustrates:

The difference between the known Earth-to-Sun maximum and minimum distances (152.1 Mkm versus 147.1 Mkm) is **5 Mkm**.

The difference between 108.2 Mkm (the radius of Venus’ orbit) and 113.2 Mkm (my postulated Ø of Earth’s orbit) is also **5 Mkm**.

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/076_Venus_VS_Earth_orbits_01.jpg)

Thus, we see that this well-known 5 Mkm difference between the Sun’s apogee and perigee (152.1 Mkm versus 147.1 Mkm) reflects the difference between Venus’s mean orbital radius (108.2 Mkm) and Earth’s posited orbital diameter in the TYCHOS (113.2 Mkm).

All in all, we may now be reasonably satisfied with our estimated value of our Earth’s orbit. It appears to be proportionally and relatively congruent with the known orbital dimensions of the Sun, Mars and Venus _in addition to_ their observed positional fluctuations. Surely, for all of these mutually-consonant distances to be entirely coincidental would be beyond extraordinary. It is therefore plausible that Earth’s orbital diameter is 113,230,000 km as posited by the TYCHOS model.
