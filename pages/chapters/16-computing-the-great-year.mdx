Chapter 16 — Computing the 25344-year “Great Year” in the TYCHOS
================================================================

So, does the TYCHOS model stand up to scrutiny, all the way to the famed ca. 25,000-26,000 year period known as the “precession of the equinoxes” _a.k.a._ “The Great Year”? Let us first verify whether the TYCHOS model can adequately explain the celestial mechanics of our nearby planets, moons and their geometrical spatial interactions over a full, so-called “Great Year”.

We know that Mars has a distinct 32-year cycle, returning to almost the same celestial place in 32 years, along with Venus, Mercury and our Moon. However, every 32 years, Mars is observed to advance (or “process”) by a tiny amount. On average this amount is by ca. 10.909 minutes of RA (Right Ascension) as longer samples of multiple 32-year periods reveal. For instance, in 352 years (32y X 11), Mars will advance by 120 min. of RA.

120 / 11 = 10.90 minutes

We may envision and define this processional motion as the secular (“long term”) processional drift of Mars’s orbital motion around our system.

Our full, 360° celestial sphere is divided in 1440 minutes. Since 1440 equals 360 X 4, Mars processes every 32 years by:

10.90 / 4 = 2.72°

So, how many 32-year-periods will the orbital “rose” pattern of Mars need in order to complete a “full processional lapping” of itself?

360° / 2.72 = 132

132 X 32 years = **4224** years (or 1,542,816 days)

Mars will employ 4224 years to complete one full, 360° lapping of its own orbital path. Let’s now see how many of their own orbits that the Sun, Mars, Venus, Mercury and the Moon will complete in 4224 years:

MARS

1,542,816 days / 730.5

\= 2112 orbits

SUN

1,542,816 days / 365.25

\= 4224 orbits

VENUS

1,542,816 days / 584.4

\= 2640 orbits

MERCURY

1,542,816 days / 116.88

\= 13200 orbits

JUPITER

1,542,816 days / 4383

\= 352 orbits

MOON

1,542,816 days / 29.22

\= 52800 orbits

As previously mentioned, the Copernically-estimated period of the so-called “precession of the equinoxes” is 25,771 years. This is the time period currently reckoned by contemporary heliocentric theory for Earth to complete its 360° equinoctial precession (_a.k.a._ “The Great Year”). So let us try and multiply our 4224-year value by 6 and see how it goes.

Why exactly by 6? I will address this further on, in Chapter 20. For now, let’s see what we obtain:

4224 years X 6 = **25344** years / or 9,256,896 days

Which will correspond to:

9,256,896 days = 12672 Mars orbits (of 730.5 days)

9,256,896 days = 25344 Sun orbits (of 365.25 days)

9,256,896 days = 79200 Mercury orbits (of 116.88 days)

9,256,896 days = 15840 Venus orbits (of 584.4 days)

9,256,896 days = 2112 Jupiter orbits (of 4383 days)

9,256,896 days = 316800 Moon orbits (of 29.22 days)

Since Mars advances by 120 min. every 352 years, in 25,344 years (which equals 352 X 72) Mars will thus advance by:

120 min. X 72 = 8640 min.

Note that 8640 min. = 1440 min. X 6 (of course, 1440 min. represents our full, 360° celestial sphere)

In other words, Mars will “lap” the Sun **6 times,** every **25344 years**.

If we consider that 25344 years represents a full 360° equinoctial precession, we should now be curious to find out how long it takes for Earth’s equinoctial axis to rotate (in relation to the stars) by just 1°. Here we go:

25344 / 360 = 70.4 solar years

We see that **70.4** solar years (or 25713.6 days) equals precisely:

33 synodic periods of Mars (779.2 days X 33 = 25713.6 days)

44 Venus orbits (584.4 days X 44 = 25713.6 days)

220 Mercury orbits (116.88 days X 220 = 25713.6 days)

880 Moon orbits (29.22 days X 880 = 25713.6 days)

It is interesting to note that in Babylonian astronomy, the “sar” cycle was an important period of 3600 years, which, when multiplied by 7.04 gets us the Tychos Great Year (TGY) length of 25344. Let us also note that 704 years (70.4 X 10) is equivalent to:

1/3rd of 2112 years

1/6th of 4224 years

1/36th of 25344 years

We can now compute Earth’s “equinoctial procession rate” as of the TYCHOS system. If Earth’s equinoxes process by 1° every 70.4 years, then every century (100 years) they process by:

100 / 70.4 = 1.42045°  
or  
5113.63 arc seconds

In 25344 years, there are 253.44 centuries. In fact, 253.44 X 1.42045° = 360°

Hence, our annual “precession rate of Earth’s equinoxes” is:

### 5113.6363 / 100 = 51.136 arc seconds\*

Note that 51.136 X 25344 equals exactly 1,296,000 arc seconds (which, of course, is equivalent to one full 360° circle).

Therefore, in several ways, we arrive at the conclusion that the Great Year is a cyclical “return” for not just Earth but the entire system.

In the following chapters, we shall see that this 51.136” value is an all-important parameter of the TYCHOS model, since it reflects the amount by which Earth moves each year as it slowly revolves around its 25,344-year “PVP” orbit at the tranquil speed of 1 mph.

Henceforth I will refer to these 51.136” arc seconds as our “Annual Constant of Precession” (or “ACP”).
