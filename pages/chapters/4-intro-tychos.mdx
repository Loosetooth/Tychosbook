Chapter 4 — Introducing the TYCHOS model
========================================

The Sun and Mars are the main players of a what I have called our 'geoaxial' binary system. At or near its barycenter, we find Earth and our Moon, while the Sun (escorted by its two moons, Mercury and Venus) and Mars (escorted by its two moons, Phobos and Deimos) perform their binary dance around our planet. It is Earth’s physical motion around its “PVP” orbit (see blue circle) that causes our North stars to change over time – a very slow process commonly-known as the “precession of the equinoxes”.

The Sun revolves once a year around Earth, traveling at 107,226 km/h (the orbital speed attributed to Earth in the Copernican model). Every circa 2.13 years, its binary companion (Mars) reconjuncts with the Sun at _either side_ of Earth (in so-called 'opposition') - as shown in my above graphic. In the TYCHOS, Earth is inclined at about 23.5° in relation to its orbital plane – yet (unlike current theory) its Northern hemisphere remains tilted at all times ‘outwards’, i.e. towards the external circuit of the Sun.

There is no need for Earth to “wobble around its polar axis” (a.k.a. "Earth's 3d motion") as of Copernican theory; nor does Earth hurtle around space at hypersonic speeds (i.e. Mach 90!). Earth only rotates around its axis once every 24 hours (at the extremely sluggish rate of 0.000694 rpm!) while it slowly gets tugged around at 1.6 km/h (about 1 mph) by our entire solar system which, almost imperceptibly, precesses 'clockwise'. In the process, Earth completes one revolution around its 'barycentric orbit' every 25344 years (a period also known as “The Great Year”). I submit that what I have called the “PVP” orbit (_“Polaris-Vega-Polaris”_) is the 'missing piece of the puzzle' of Tycho Brahe's ingenious (and near-flawless) geoheliocentric system. My proposed "PVP" orbit will of course be thoroughly expounded and illustrated in this book, as it constitutes the core discovery upon which the TYCHOS model is founded.

For most of his life, Tycho Brahe apparently believed that Earth was totally stationary, did not rotate around its axis - and that the stars all revolved around it in unison every 24 hours. One can only wonder how Tycho reconciled this belief with, for instance, the slow alternation of our polar stars (as well-documented throughout the ages). Eventually however (in 1622), Tycho’s trusty assistant Longomontanus (in his _Astronomia Danica_, regarded as “Tycho’s testament”) allowed for Earth’s daily rotation around its axis in what became known as the “semi-Tychonic” system. To this day, the accuracy of Longomontanus’ refined version of his master's geoheliocentric model has never been surpassed:

> Longomontanus, Tycho’s sole disciple, assumed the responsibility and fulfilled both tasks in his voluminous ‘Astronomia Danica’ (1622). Regarded as the testament of Tycho, the work was eagerly received in seventeenth-century astronomical literature. But unlike Tycho’s, his geoheliocentric model gave the Earth a daily rotation as in the models of Ursus and Roslin, and which is sometimes called the ‘semi-Tychonic’ system. \[…\] Some historians of science claim Kepler’s 1627 ‘Rudolphine Tables’ based on Tycho Brahe’s observations were more accurate than any previous tables. But nobody has ever demonstrated they were more accurate than Longomontanus’s 1622 ‘Danish Astronomy’ tables, also based upon Tycho’s observations.

In short, the TYCHOS is a natural evolution of the semi-Tychonic system and its unequaled consistency with empirical observation; it provides a long-overdue reassessment and completion of the extraordinary work of Tycho Brahe and Longomontanus which, sadly and inexplicably, was eclipsed by the emergence of the Copernican theory – in spite of its numerous problems and aberrations. As we shall see, these problems stem from the distinctly unphysical nature of its proposed heliocentric geometry. It is a poorly-known fact that the Copernican theory was (justly) rejected for several decades by the world's scientific community - due the many leaps of logic that its core tenets demanded. One of the most formidable mental efforts required (in order to accept the novel Copernican theory) was the extraordinary dimensions and distances that the stars would have in relation to our system. Another huge problem was, of course, the ludicrous notion that our tranquil planet Earth would be hurtling around the Sun at no less than 90X the speed of sound!... 

> Most scientists refused to accept \[Copernicus’s\] theory for many decades — even after Galileo made his epochal observations with his telescope. Their objections were not only theological. Observational evidence supported a competing cosmology,the “geo-heliocentrism” of Tycho Brahe. The most devastating argument against the Copernican universe was the star size problem. Rather than give up their theory in the face of seemingly incontrovertible physical evidence, Copernicans were forced to appeal to divine omnipotence.

***THE TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator***

The TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator is a joint effort by yours truly and Patrik Holmqvist, a Swedish IT programmer I had the good fortune to meet in the summer of 2017. At the time of this writing (January 2022), we are now both satisfied that it represents the most truthful and accurate digital simulator of our Solar System ever devised. As I timidly started my TYCHOS research around the summer of 2013, I certainly had no ambition or pretense to build a planetarium that could equal / challenge / let alone supersede (in accuracy) the existing Copernican / heliocentric planetariums! However, as my research slowly progressed over the years, I started day-dreaming of meeting some IT genius who could help me construct a digital interactive simulator of my theoretical TYCHOS model (as imagined and computed solely 'on paper'). To make a long story short, the TYCHOSIUM 3D is a dream come true. 

**I strongly encourage all the readers (before proceeding to read this book) to open the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator on their laptop computers and to get familiar with it and its functions. This is an essential requirement in order to comprehend the TYCHOS model (i.e. the true configuration of our Solar System).**

Next, we shall take a close look at Mars, famously considered by Johannes Kepler to be the _"key to understanding the Solar System"._ Mars is veritably the 'Master Key' that unveils the mechanics of our own little cosmic system. Ironically though, in spite of his relentless and long-lasting efforts, Kepler never found it - and ultimately resorted to forge it!
