Chapter 4 — Introducing the TYCHOS model
========================================

The Sun and Mars are the main players of a what I have called our 'geoaxial' binary system. At or near its barycenter, we find Earth and our Moon, while the Sun (escorted by its two moons, Mercury and Venus) and Mars (escorted by its own two moons, Phobos and Deimos) perform their binary dance around our planet. It is Earth’s physical motion around its “PVP” orbit (see blue circle) that causes our North stars to change over time – a very slow process commonly-known as the “precession of the equinoxes”.

The Sun revolves once a year around Earth, traveling at 107,226 km/h (i.e. the orbital speed attributed to Earth as of current theory). Every 2.13 years, its binary companion (Mars) reconjuncts with the Sun at _either side_ of Earth (in so-called 'opposition') - as shown in my above graphic. In the TYCHOS, Earth is inclined at about 23.5° in relation to its orbital plane – yet its Northern hemisphere remains tilted at all times ‘outwards’, i.e. towards the external circuit of the Sun.

There is no need for Earth to “wobble around its polar axis” (a.k.a. "Earth's 3d motion") as of Copernican theory; nor does Earth hurtle around space at hypersonic speeds (i.e. Mach 90!). Earth only rotates around its axis once every 24 hours (at the extremely sluggish rate of 0.000694 rpm!) while it slowly gets tugged around at 1.6 km/h (about 1 mph) by our entire solar system which, over time, precesses 'clockwise'. In the process, Earth completes one revolution around its 'barycentric orbit' every 25344 years (a period also known as “The Great Year”). I submit that what I have called the “PVP” orbit (_“Polaris-Vega-Polaris”_) is the 'missing piece of the puzzle' of Tycho Brahe's ingenious (and near-flawless) geoheliocentric system. My proposed "PVP" orbit will of course be thoroughly expounded and illustrated further on in this book, as it constitutes the core discovery upon which my TYCHOS model is founded.

It is essential to understand that, in the TYCHOS model, all of the planets and moons orbit at **CONSTANT speeds around UNIFORMLY CIRCULAR (albeit eccentric) ORBITS**. In other words, there never was any need for Kepler's VARIABLE orbital speeds or for his proposed ELLIPTICAL orbits - the latter being just an illusion caused by Earth's motion around its "PVP" orbit: to wit, since Earth very slowly proceeds along an almost straight line (over, say, 100 years) this illusion is due to the Sun (and all the other bodies of our system) revolving at very high speeds around our planet; in the summer (of the Northern Hemisphere), the Sun will thus be moving in the _opposite_ direction of Earth whereas, in the winter, it will move in the _same_ direction as Earth. Hence, the illusion of 'elliptical orbits' is created - while the other illusion of "variable speeds" is simply created by the variable _distances_ between Earth and the various bodies of our solar system (since their orbits are all eccentric, which means to say that they are 'off-center' in relation to Earth). 

You may now ask the age-old question: _"Orbital speeds? In relation to WHAT?"_ The simple answer is: in relation to the so-called 'fixed' stars. Yes, all the stars also move a tiny weeny bit every year (in all imaginable directions), yet they do so by what we can justly and comfortably call "a negligible amount". Hence, we should be satisfied that the star backdrop (a.k.a. "the firmament") constitutes a reasonably reliable and near-static reference against which we may compute the orbital speeds of the fast-moving bodies of our Solar System. 

Another essential point to understand is that astronomers (who espouse the heliocentric / Copernican theory) have correctly determined the distances to the bodies COMPRISED IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. This, because they have been using as a baseline (for their parallax triangulations) the diameter of Earth - of 12,756km (a well-established and thoroughly verified measurement). Yet, their determination of the distances TO THE STARS is **an entirely different matter**. This, because they have used as a baseline (for their parallax triangulations) the supposed diameter of Earth's alleged orbit around the Sun - of ca. 300 million kilometers. Hence, since they use as a baseline this hypothetical 300Mkm lateral six-month-displacement of Earth, ALL of their calculations as to the Earth-->Stars distances are sistematically flawed. In reality (according to the TYCHOS model, that is), Earth only moves by 7018km every six months - and not by 300Mkm. This means that the stars are more than 42,600X closer than currently believed. All of this will be expounded and illustrated in due detail further on in this book.

The TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator is a joint effort by yours truly and Patrik Holmqvist, a Swedish IT programmer I had the good fortune to meet in the summer of 2017. At the time of this writing (January 2022), it is still a "work in progress" - yet we are now both satisfied of its potential to become the most truthful and accurate digital simulator of our Solar System ever devised. As I timidly started my TYCHOS research around the summer of 2013, I certainly had no ambition or pretense to build a planetarium that could equal / challenge / let alone supersede (in accuracy) the existing Copernican / heliocentric planetariums! However, as this research progressed over the years, I started day-dreaming of meeting some IT genius-wizard who could help me construct a digital interactive simulator of my theoretical TYCHOS model. At the time, it was only an imagined concept lingering in my mind - and merely computed 'on paper'. To make a long story short - and to spare you from accounts of our many child-like bursts of excitement as Patrik and I realized its potential - I will just say that the TYCHOSIUM 3D is a dream come true. 

**I strongly encourage all the readers (before proceeding to read this book) to open the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator on their laptop computers and to get familiar with it and its functions. This is an essential requirement in order to comprehend and empirically visualize the workings of the TYCHOS model.**

A detailed "users manual" of the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator can be found in the scroll-down menu (at the righthand side of the screen).

Here are a few tips for beginners:

1- Click the "run" button to start the TYCHOSIUM. You may then choose to speed up (or slow down) its motion with the "1 second equals" function. 
 
2- Use the left-click of your mouse to toggle at will the 3-D orientation of our Solar System. 
 
3- Click on the "trace" menu and choose any celestial body for which you wish to exhibit its path around our system over the years. This will show you the wonderful "mandala-like" trajectories of our Solar System's bodies - such as the gorgeous 'flower' traced by Venus.
 
4- To see the zodiac ring (which shows the orientation of our zodiac's 12 constellations), click on the "objects" menu and check the 'Zodiac' box.

5- To see the celestial positions of any of our solar system's bodies, click on the'Positions' box. You may then compare and verify the accuracy of the TYCHOSIUM 3D with any other online planetariums such as the famous [Stellarium simulator](https://stellarium-web.org/)

Enjoy! And always keep in mind that the TYCHOSIUM has all of our solar systems' bodies moving at CONSTANT SPEEDS and around UNIFORMLY CIRCULAR orbits.

Next, we shall take a close look at Mars, famously considered by Johannes Kepler to be the _"key to understanding the Solar System"._ Mars is veritably the 'Master Key' that unveils the mechanics of our own little cosmic system. Ironically though, in spite of his painstaking and (purely mathematical) long-lasting efforts, Kepler never found that all-important key - and ultimately resorted to forge it!
