Chapter 4 — Introducing the TYCHOS model
========================================

The Sun and Mars are the main players of a what I have called our 'geoaxial' binary system. At or near its barycenter, we find Earth and our Moon, while the Sun (escorted by its two moons, Mercury and Venus) and Mars (escorted by its own two moons, Phobos and Deimos) perform their binary dance around our planet. It is Earth’s physical motion around its “PVP” orbit (see blue circle) that causes our North stars to change over time – a very slow process commonly-known as the “precession of the equinoxes”.

In the TYCHOS, Earth is inclined at about 23.5° in relation to its orbital plane – yet its Northern hemisphere remains tilted at all times ‘outwards’, i.e. towards the external circuit of the Sun. The Sun revolves once a year around Earth, traveling at 107,226 km/h (i.e. the orbital speed attributed to Earth by current theory). Every 2.13 years, its binary companion - Mars - reconjuncts with the Sun at _either side_ of Earth (in my above graphic we see Mars transiting in so-called 'opposition'). Therefore, Mars is not a "third moon of the Sun" (an objection raised by some commentators) since it is the only orb in our cosmic neighborhood whose orbit makes it alternately transit in opposition to - or in conjunction with - the Sun. The only reason why Mars may seem problematic to reconcile with our pre-conceived notion of 'binary motions' is because its orbit isn't locked in a 1:1 ratio with the Sun - but rather at a 2:1 ratio. Hence, Mars will not return in opposition every year - but only every other year (or so).   

Each year, Earth moves ('clockwise' - as seen for above our North Pole) by about 14 thousand kilometers along its "PVP" orbit - i.e. slightly more than its own diameter of 12,756km. This motion of Earth goes to explain - in the simplest possible manner - the observed annual 'backward' motion of our stars (commonly-known as "the Precession of the Equinoxes"). There is no need for Earth to “wobble around its polar axis” (a.k.a. "Earth's 3d motion") as of Copernican theory; nor does Earth hurtle around space at hypersonic speeds. Earth only rotates around its axis once every 24 hours - _at the extremely sluggish rate of 0.000694 rpm!_ - while it gently gets tugged around its orbital path at 1.6 km/h (about 1 mph) by our entire solar system which, over time, precesses 'clockwise'. In the process, Earth completes one revolution around its 'barycentric' orbit every 25344 years (a period also known as “The Great Year”). I submit that what I have called the “PVP” orbit (_“Polaris-Vega-Polaris”_) is the missing piece of the puzzle of Tycho Brahe's ingenious (and near-flawless) geoheliocentric system. My proposed "PVP" orbit will of course be thoroughly expounded and illustrated further on in this book, as it constitutes the core discovery upon which my TYCHOS model is founded.

It is essential to understand that, in the TYCHOS model, all of the planets and moons orbit at **CONSTANT speeds around UNIFORMLY CIRCULAR (albeit eccentric) orbits**. In other words, there never was any need for Kepler's VARIABLE orbital speeds or for his proposed ELLIPTICAL orbits - the latter being just an illusion caused by Earth's motion around its "PVP" orbit: to wit, since Earth very slowly proceeds along an almost straight line (over, say, 100 years) this illusion is due to the Sun (and all the other bodies of our system) revolving at very high speeds around our planet; in the summer (of the Northern Hemisphere), the Sun will thus be moving in the _opposite_ direction of Earth whereas, in the winter, it will move in the _same_ direction as Earth. Thus, the illusion of 'elliptical orbits' is created - while the other illusion of "variable speeds" is simply caused by the fluctuating _distances_ between Earth and the various bodies of our solar system (since their orbits are all eccentric, which means to say that they are all somewhat 'off-center' in relation to Earth). 

You may now ask the age-old question: _"Orbital speeds? In relation to WHAT?"_ The short answer is: in relation to the 'fixed' stars. Now, the stars also have so-called ['proper motions'](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bds2/ltsn/ljm/JAVA/PROPER/proper.htm) of their own. That is, they move a tiny weeny bit every year - in random directions - yet they do so by what can comfortably call a negligible amount (the typical proper motion of a star is ~0.1 arcsec/year). Hence, we should be satisfied that the star backdrop (a.k.a. "the firmament") constitutes a quite reliable, near-static reference against which we may compute the orbital speeds of the various bodies comprised in our Solar System - providing that we duly account for Earth's own orbital motion. What is empirically observed is that ALL the stars (i.e. our entire firmament) drift _from west to east_ in our skies by a little more than 50 arcsec/year each year. In the TYCHOS model, this slow 25344-year revolution of our firmament is quite simply caused by Earth's very tranquil 1-mph motion around its "PVP" orbit. 

DISTANCES TO OUR SOLAR SYSTEM'S BODIES versus DISTANCES TO THE STARS

Another fundamental point to understand is that the TYCHOS has rigorously respected the currently-accepted distances **- as measured by Copernican / Keplerian astronomers -** between the bodies _comprised in our own solar system_. This, because they have (correctly) been using as a baseline for their measurements the diameter of Earth of 12,756km (a well-established and thoroughly verified length). However, their determination of the Earth-->stars distances is **an entirely different matter**. This, because they have (incorrectly) used as a baseline the supposed diameter of Earth's alleged orbit around the Sun - of ca. 300 million kilometers. Since they are using as a baseline this (non-existent) _300Mkm lateral six-month-displacement of Earth_, all of their calculations of Earth-to-stars distances are sistematically flawed (i.e. grossly magnified). In the TYCHOS model, Earth only moves by 7018km every six months - instead of 300,000,000km. This means that the stars are more than 42,600X closer than currently believed - a notion that Tycho Brahe would undoubtedly have warmly welcomed and supported! To be sure, the notion that some of our more distant stars (**visible to our naked eyes**) would be located _several thousands light years away_ has to rank among the wackiest ideas entertained by this world's scientific community.

***THE TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator***  

>"So Mathematical Truth prefers simple words since the language of Truth is itself simple." - Tycho Brahe

As I timidly started my TYCHOS research back in 2013, I certainly had no ambition or pretense (not even in my wildest dreams) to build a digital planetarium that could remotely challenge the accuracy of existing, heliocentric simulators of our Solar System. All my calculations for my imagined, fledgling model were done with 'pen and paper' - and with the aid of simple graphic editing programs. However, as my research progressed over the years, I gradually started daydreaming of meeting some IT-wizard who might help me try and 'animate' my TYCHOS model on some interactive digital 3D platform, so as to "bring it to life". As fate would have it, this is precisely what happened - so you can count me today as one of the happiest men walking on planet Earth!

The Tychosium 3D simulator is a joint effort by yours truly and Patrik Holmqvist, a Swedish IT programmer I had the good fortune to meet in the summer of 2017. At the time of writing (January 2022), the Tychosium is still a 'work in progress' - yet we are both satisfied of its potential to become the most realistic and accurate digital simulator of our Solar System ever devised. The principal feature of its superior nature lies in the fact that it should (once completed) correctly show the conjunctions of the bodies of our Solar System _with the stars_ - without any geometric aberrations of parallax & perspective (unlike any heliocentric simulators of its genre). This crucial aspect of the TYCHOS model will be thoroughly expounded and illustrated in this book. The Tychosium 3D simulator thus fulfills the age-old quest pursued by most astronomers of antiquity: to devise a working model of our Solar System based on uniformly circular orbits and constant orbital speeds.

**I hereby vividly encourage all the readers (before proceeding) to open the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator on their laptop computers and get familiar with its interactive functions. This is an essential requirement in order to fully visualize, assess and comprehend the workings of the TYCHOS model.**

Patrik and I wish you to enjoy the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator which, we dare say, is the most truthful simulator of our Solar System ever devised. As you do so, please keep in mind that the TYCHOSIUM has _all of our solar systems' bodies_ moving at CONSTANT SPEEDS around UNIFORMLY CIRCULAR orbits. This is of course not the case in the Copernican model (and its digital simulators) which require them to move at VARIABLE SPEEDS around ELLIPTICAL orbits. Yet, and 'in spite of this', the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator currently has all the bodies of our Solar System nicely agreeing (to a high degree of accuracy) with most astronomical tables and ephemerides gathered throughout the centuries.  

And remember: ALL of the star systems observed in modern times feature the sort of spirographic / trochoidal orbital patterns traced in the TYCHOSIUM simulator. To think that our own Solar System - and our Solar System only! - would _NOT_ feature such complex and beautiful orbital patterns is, you may agree, simply absurd (the below diagram is described and referenced in Chapter2 of this book).

A detailed "users manual" of the TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator can be found in the scroll-down menu (at the righthand side of the screen).

Here are a few tips for beginners:

1- Click the "run" button to start the TYCHOSIUM. You may then choose to speed up or slow down its motion with the "1 second equals" function. 
 
2- Left-clicking (and holding) your mouse will let you toggle at will the 3-D orientation of our cosmos. The scroll wheel regulates the zoom level.
 
3- Click on the "Trace" menu and choose any celestial body for which you wish to exhibit its path around our system over time. This will show you the beautiful "mandala-like", spirographic trajectories of our Solar System's various bodies - such as the charming '5 petalled-flower' traced by Venus.
 
4- To see the orientation of our zodiac's 12 constellations, click on the "objects" menu and check the 'Zodiac' box.

5- To see the celestial positions of any of our solar system's bodies, click on the'Positions' box. You may then compare and verify for yourselves the accordance of the TYCHOSIUM 3D with other online planetariums such as the popular [Stellarium simulator](https://stellarium-web.org/)

So far, the TYCHOSIUM has attained excellent concordance with all recorded Mars oppositions, all transits of Venus and Mercury across the Sun's disk, all Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions (and most other periodic interplanetary alignments) and most of all solar and lunar eclipses. Admittedly, a few issues remain to be addressed (e.g. our Moon's secular declinations) yet we are confident that they will be resolved with further fine-tuning of the simulator. After all, the Tychosium 3D simulator is - at this moment - the result of the best efforts of only two human brains!

In the next chapter, we shall take a close look at Mars, famously considered by Johannes Kepler to be the _"key to understanding the Solar System"._ Mars is veritably the 'Master Key' that unveils the true configuration and mechanics of our own little cosmic system. Ironically though, in spite of his painstaking and long-lasting efforts (as he doggedly tried to reconcile Mars's motions within a heliocentric paradigm), Kepler never found that all-important key... so he ultimately resorted to forge it!
