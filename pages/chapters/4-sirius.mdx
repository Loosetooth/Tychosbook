Chapter 4 — Sirius A and B — “Living proof” in support of the TYCHOS model
==========================================================================

One of the first objections that opponents of the TYCHOS model will submit is that Mars is far-too-small-a-celestial-body to be our Sun's "dance partner". They argue that it would gravely contradict Newton's gravitational Laws - and that Mars could not possibly be the Sun's binary companion - as it would immediately crash into the Sun. 

Well, it is a matter of historical record that when the first binary star systems were discovered, our world's astronomers were totally stumped: the extremely small size of some of these newly-detected star companions (that they kept finding thanks to improved telescopes and spectroscopes) made no sense at all - that is, within the framework of Sir Isaac Newton's gravitational 'Laws'. For instance, here's what none other than astronomer Royal Sir Arthur Eddington had to say - following the discovery of Sirius B (the tiny binary companion of Sirius A):

_"We learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages which their light brings to us. The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: 'I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox.' What reply can one make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was — **"Shut up. Don't talk nonsense."**_(Sir Arthur Eddington) [White Darf - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf)

In fact, nonsense it was! And as these small binary companions were discovered, Newton's sacrosanct "laws" were in grave danger of catastrophic collapse. Eventually though, the whole question was 'settled' by what must be one of the most egregious case of outright chicanery in the history of astronomy: the ad hoc 'resolution' of the mystery went as follows: if Sirius B is so very small, then it must be made of _extraordinarily DENSE matter_... Today, astronomy students are actually taught that a sugar cube on Sirius B would weigh some 1000 kg - because the forces of gravity on Sirius B are 400,000X stronger than on planet Earth! That's right, we are told that Sirius B is 'heavier' than our Sun - because its atoms are packed four-hundred-thousand times tighter than our earthly atoms! I trust that anyone (graced with earnest brain matter) can see what most of our world's scientific community did there - in the name of their untouchable "Science God", Sir Isaac Newton.


The very brightest of all the stars in our skies is Sirius. It is a 'classic' binary system composed of at least two bodies: the large Sirius A and the midget Sirius B, the two of which revolve (in intersecting orbits) around their common barycenter. The tiny companion "Sirius B" was discovered as late (or as recently, if you will) as 1862 by Alvan Clark, with what was then the world’s largest refractor telescope. As we shall see further on, a third body ("Sirius C") is now suspected to be part of the Sirius system - even though it is invisible to our modern telescopes. So let us first take a look at the two visible - and confirmed - bodies (A and B) of the Sirius binary system.  

This is the first photograph of SIRIUS A and Sirius B (by Lindenblad — 1973):

Here is how some astronomy websites illustrate the orbits of SIRIUS A and Sirius B. As you can see, the two bodies are presumed to orbit around nothing at all - or rather, around their common "center of mass" (or barycenter):

N°1 OBJECTION TO THE TYCHOS MODEL: _“Preposterous! Our tiny little Mars is **far too small** to be the Sun’s binary companion!”_

Well, I shall now demonstrate that this objection is a non-starter, since it is readily invalidated by the empirically observable fact that the diameters of Sirius A and Sirius B are proportionally identical to our Sun and Mars.

Please note that I am about to compare solely _the observed, relative angular diameters_ of Sirius A and Sirius B — since any estimation of their respective masses is nothing that can be empirically verified from Earth. In fact, all mass-estimates of distant celestial bodies have been based, to this day, upon Einstein’s and Newton’s postulated 'laws' and formulae which, in later decades, have been profoundly questioned and /or thoroughly falsified. Astronomy literature offers no rational explanation as to why the “midget star” Sirius B, believed to be slightly smaller than our planet (_"91.6% of Earth’s diameter"_) would have a larger mass than that of our Sun. On Wikimedia we may, still today, read utterly outlandish claims such as: 

> _"The gravity on the surface of Sirius B is 400,000 times that of Earth!"_

— [Sirius A and B - A Double-Star System](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sirius_A_and_B-_A_Double-Star_System_in_the_Constellation_Canis_Major_(2940666747).jpg)

As for the diameter and mass of Sirius B, here's what we may read on Wikipedia:

> _“In 2005, using the Hubble telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, 12,000 kilometres, with a mass 102% of the Sun’s.”_
— Wikipedia entry on [“Sirius”](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Sirius.pdf)

You see, the current scientific reasoning in astronomy circles goes a bit like this (paraphrasing):

**_“Since Newton’s Gravitational Laws predict so elegantly the masses of our own solar system, our entire universe must therefore obey the same laws. Therefore, since Sirius B is far smaller than Sirius A (yet the two of them revolve around their common barycenter), then the mass of Sirius B must be phenomenally large.”_**

I trust that anyone can sense the inherent fallacy of such 'logic'. What we have here is nothing but a textbook case of 'ad hoc confirmation bias' on the part of our world’s Copernican astronomers. So let us shove aside for now the abstract question of the (unmeasurable) masses of the distant bodies in our skies - and just assess the (measurable) _relative_ diameters of our Sun and Mars, and contrast them directly with those of Sirius A & B (as estimated by Copernican astronomers):

Diameter of SIRIUS A: 2,390,000 km 
Diameter of SIRIUS B: 11,684.4 km

**Ergo: Sirius B’s diameter is 0.4888 % that of SIRIUS A**

Diameter of our Sun: 1,391,400 km  
Diameter of Mars: 6792.4 km  

**Ergo: Mars’s diameter is 0.4881 % that of the SUN**

That’s right — **0.4888% versus 0.4881%** … a proportional difference of barely 0.0007%! 

Thus, since the _relative_ diameters of SUN & MARS versus those of SIRIUS A & SIRIUS B are near-identical, the objection that _“Mars is far too small to be the binary companion of the Sun”_ can be promptly dismissed and discarded as an inherently fallacious statement. The very existence of the Sirius A – Sirius B binary system constitutes verifiable, empirical evidence that such a system can (and does) exist in our cosmos. 

Perhaps an easier way to memorize this proportional / relative equality between the Sirius system and our own Solar System (which, to my knowledge, no one has ever pointed out to this day) is to express it as follows:

Sirius B is approximately **204** times smaller than Sirius A - and Mars is approximately **204** times smaller than the Sun.

Remarkable, isn't it? The two components of the brightest binary star system in our sky are proportionally identical to the Sun and Mars! Is this just some random coincidence - unworthy of any serious consideration? If you are inclined to dismiss it all as mere happenstance, you are - by all means - free to do so. However, this observable fact should crush any objection to the TYCHOS model's main contention: namely, that the Sun and the midget Mars are binary companions - much like Sirius A and the midget Sirius B are empirically observed to be.

Well, I would suggest that a man standing on Sirius (let's call him "Joe") and looking towards our Solar System would see something like this:

![](http://www.septclues.com/TYCHOS/Mars_SiriusB_analogies_02.jpg)

As you can see in my above illustration, it would be extremely difficult (or perhaps quite impossible) for our Joe to see Earth at all - due to the blinding glare of our Sun. Conversely, the same would be true for any earthly observer trying to detect the elusive "Sirius C". You may now rightly ask: "what is Sirius C?" Well, here we go.    


**ABOUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF "SIRIUS C"**

As it is, there may be even more astonishing similarities in store between the Sirius binary system and our own Sun/Mars binary system; although further studies are needed to confirm its existence, it would appear that the Sirius binary system may well harbor a third body – provisionally named “Sirius C”. We shall now take a look at what is currently known about this long-debated _third_ component of the Sirius system - and its most fascinating implications (as viewed under the TYCHOS model's proposed configuration of our Solar System). 

A fairly recent (1994) French astrophysical study concluded that there are fairly strong indications for the existence of "Sirius C":  
[Is Sirius a Triple Star?](https://www.tychos.info/citation/017A_Is-Sirius-Triple-Star.pdf) by D. Benest and J.L. Duvent (1994) for _Astronomy and Astrophysics_ 299, 621-628

Here's an extract of the above paper (which is well worth reading in its entirety). The Benest-Duvent study basically concludes that the "Sirius C" object may well exist, that it has a far lower mass than its two binary companions and that its most likely 'host star' is the large Sirius A (rather than the midget Sirius B):

Before proceeding, let us look at this conventional diagram that illustrates the intersecting orbits of Sirius A and Sirius B - as they are viewed from Earth:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/SIRIUS_A_and_B_orbit_diagram_01.jpg)

The above diagram shows how modern astronomers have interpreted the relative motions of Sirius A and Sirius B: they both revolve in intersecting orbits around... nothing at all! (or, if you will, 'around their common barycenter'). But what if we place that conjectured "Sirius C" in the middle of Sirius A's orbit? In my below graphic, I show how such a situation would compare with the Sun/Mars binary system proposed by my TYCHOS model:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/SIRIUSSYSTEM_vs_SOLARSYSTEM_01.jpg)

Please note the most remarkable aspect revealed by my above comparison: we know that the Mars-to-Earth distances (from perigee to apogee) can vary by a 1-to-7 ratio. Well, this would also be the case if "Sirius C" existed and were located in the middle of Sirius A's orbit (as shown in my above diagram): the SiriusB-to-SiriusC distances would also vary by a 1-to-7 ratio. Needless to say, if this were truly the case, we may reasonably entertain the very fascinating possibility of "Sirius C" being some sort of 'twin sister' of Earth!

**THE DOGON TRIBE'S CURIOUS SIRIUS WORSHIP**

“Emme Tolo” is the name given to the elusive "Sirius C" by the DOGON, an ancient African tribe that worshipped the brightest star in our skies. In fact, it still remains a veritable mystery how the Dogons even knew of the existence of the tiny Sirius B, since it is not (currently) visible without a telescope.

The below diagram (author unknown) can be found on various 'alternative' websites depicting a proposed configuration of the Sirius system. Interestingly, it appears to feature the elusive “Sirius C” (_a.k.a._ “Emme Tolo”) positioned at the barycenter of the Sirius A / B binary system:

[The Dogons and the Stars of Sirius](https://www.tychos.info/citation/017B_Pacal-Dogon.htm)_ by Pacal Votan (2007)


Additionally, the Dogons somehow also knew about an even smaller body revolving (in lunar fashion) around “Emme Tolo” (Sirius C) — much like our Moon revolves around Earth. They named this satellite 'Nyan Tolo' which translates as “the Women’s Star”. Of course, our Moon (_la Luna_ in Italian, and in Greek mythology represented by the goddess Selene) has always been “the women’s star”, what with its sidereal orbital period of 27.3 days (which approximately matches the average female menstrual cycle).

[The Dogon Tribe: Connection Sirius](https://www.tychos.info/citation/017C_Dogon-Sirius.htm)- by Ivan Petricevic (2007)

I don’t wish to dwell too long on the Dogons and their apparent, inexplicably-advanced knowledge of the Sirius system, since this rather 'esoteric' topic appears to have been, in later years, sensationalized and exploited (to generate book sales) by a number of authors from the so-called "New Age crowd" - and submerged by a dross of fanciful conjectures. Suffice to say that we simply don’t know how the ancient Dogon tribe acquired this knowledge. It seems unlikely, however, that this entire Dogon affair is just a figment of someone’s imagination. Whether or not it is a fictitious legend of popular lore will not change the observable facts: Sirius B does indeed exist and "Sirius C", as we have seen, may well exist as well. In any event, if it should eventually turn out that Sirius C (“Emme Tolo”) and its moon (“Nyan Tolo”) both exist, we will have to seriously consider the compelling eventuality that the Sirius System is some sort of “**Twin family**” of our own Solar System:

| OBJECT   |     TWIN     |
|----------|:------------:|
| Sun      | Sirius A     |
| Mars     | Sirius B     |
| Earth    | Sirius C     |
| Moon     | "Nyan Tolo"  |

![](http://septclues.com/TYCHOS/TWIN_FAMILY_of_SiriusSystem_01.jpg)

So, once more: would it be 'preposterous' to contend that Mars is the Sun’s binary companion? Would the (alleged) huge mass of the Sun versus the (alleged) tiny mass of Mars rule out the idea that the two of them are binary companions? According to modern astrophysics, given the currently-assumed masses of Sun and Mars, _yes_. Nonetheless, I think it is now wise to question whether these “mass” assumptions – as postulated by Sir Isaac Newton – have any foundation in reality.

In conclusion, I submit that the very existence of the Sirius system is strongly supportive of the TYCHOS model's tenets. It provides empirical evidence that a very small celestial body can indeed be the binary companion of a far larger celestial body. In any event, the simple fact that the _relative diameters_ of Sirius A and B are identical to our Sun and Mars cannot reasonably be dismissed offhand as a mere coincidence. Let me highlight these facts once again:  

**- SiriusA is near-exactly 204X larger than SiriusB** 
**- The Sun is near-exactly 204X larger than Mars**

To be sure, this has not been noticed by any astronomers to this day: it was one of my first realizations that led me to embark in this most enthralling research journey based on Tycho Brahe's unjustly abandoned geoheliocentric model of our Solar System.  

Next, I will introduce the basic configuration of the TYCHOS Sun/Mars geoaxial binary system. Although it may seem somewhat premature to unveil it at this early stage, I feel it is necessary in order for the reader to get a general overview of the TYCHOS before tackling the successive chapters.
