Chapter 4 — Sirius A and B — “Living proof” in support of the TYCHOS model
==========================================================================

The very brightest of all the stars in our skies is Sirius. It is a 'classic' binary system composed of at least two bodies: the large Sirius A and the midget Sirius B, the two of which revolve (in intersecting orbits) around their common barycenter. The tiny companion "Sirius B" was discovered as late (or as recently, if you will) as 1862 by Alvan Clark, with what was then the world’s largest refractor telescope. As we shall see further on, a third body ("Sirius C") is now suspected to be part of the Sirius system - even though it is invisible to our modern telescopes. So let us first take a look at the two visible - and confirmed - bodies (A and B) of the Sirius binary system.  

This is the first photograph of SIRIUS A and Sirius B (by Lindenblad — 1973):

Here is how some astronomy websites illustrate the orbits of SIRIUS A and Sirius B. As you can see, the two bodies are presumed to orbit around nothing at all - or rather, around their common "center of mass" (or barycenter):

As mentioned in Chapter 2, binary systems such as the Sirius A and Sirius B duo (what with their vastly unequal sizes) pose a very serious problem for Einstein’s theory of general relativity (as well as for Newton’s gravitational laws). The issue of the relative dimensions of Sirius A and B is, of course, of primary interest to the TYCHOS model: to wit, the very first objection that Copernican astronomers will have against the notion that Mars is the Sun’s binary companion will, inevitably, be the following:

_“Preposterous! Our tiny little Mars is **far too small** to be the Sun’s binary companion!”_

Well, I shall now demonstrate that this objection is a non-starter, since it is readily invalidated by the empirically observable fact that the diameters of Sirius A and Sirius B are proportionally identical to our Sun and Mars.

Please note that I am about to compare solely _the observed, relative angular diameters_ of Sirius A and Sirius B — since any estimation of their respective masses is nothing that can be empirically verified from Earth. In fact, all mass-estimates of distant celestial bodies have been based, to this day, upon Einstein’s and Newton’s postulated 'laws' which, in later decades, have been profoundly questioned and /or definitively falsified. Astronomy literature offers no rational explanation as to why the “midget star” Sirius B, believed to be slightly smaller than our planet (_"91.6% of Earth’s diameter"_) would have a larger mass than that of our Sun! On Wikimedia we may, still today, read extraordinary claims such as: 

> _"The gravity on the surface of Sirius B is 400,000 times that of Earth!"

As for the diameter and mass of Sirius B, here's what we may read on Wikipedia:

> _“In 2005, using the Hubble telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, 12,000 kilometres, with a mass 102% of the Sun’s.”_
— Wikipedia entry on [“Sirius”](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Sirius.pdf)

You see, the current scientific reasoning in astronomy circles goes a bit like this (paraphrasing):

**_“Since Newton’s Gravitational Laws predict so elegantly the masses of our own solar system, our entire universe must therefore obey the same laws. Therefore, since Sirius B is far smaller than Sirius A (yet the two of them revolve around their common barycenter), then the mass of Sirius B must be phenomenally large.”_**

I trust that anyone can sense the inherent fallacy of such 'logic'. What we have here is nothing but a textbook case of 'ad hoc confirmation bias' on the part of our world’s Copernican astronomers. So let us now set aside the mass question and just compare the observable, relative diameters of our Sun and Mars, and contrast them directly with those of Sirius A & B.

Diameter of SIRIUS A: 2,390,000 km  
Diameter of SIRIUS B: 11,684.4 km  
**Ergo: Sirius B’s diameter is 0.4888 % that of SIRIUS A**

Diameter of our Sun: 1,391,400 km  
Diameter of Mars: 6792.4 km  
**Ergo: Mars’s diameter is 0.4881 % that of the SUN**

That’s right — **0.4888% versus 0.4881%** … a proportional difference of barely 0.0007%! 

Thus, since the relative diameters of SUN & MARS versus those of SIRIUS A & SIRIUS B are near-identical, the objection that _“Mars is far too small to be the binary companion of the Sun”_ can be promptly dismissed and discarded as an inherently fallacious statement. The very existence of the Sirius A – Sirius B binary system constitutes verifiable, empirical evidence that such a system can (and does) exist in our cosmos. 

Perhaps an easier way to remember this proportional equality between the Sirius system and our own Solar System _(which, to my knowledge, no one has ever pointed out to this day)_ is to express it as follows:

**Sirius B is approximately 204 times smaller than Sirius A.**
and...
**Mars is approximately 204 times smaller than the Sun.**

Imagine that for a moment - and give it another thought: _the two components of the brightest star system in our sky are proportionally identical to the Sun and Mars!_ Is this just some random coincidence? If you are inclined to dismiss it as such, you are - by all means - free to do so. However, this observable fact should put to rest any offhand objection as to the sheer plausibility (notwithstanding Newton's gravitational 'laws') of our big Sun and the far smaller “planet” Mars being binary companions.


**ABOUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF "SIRIUS C"**

As it is, there may be even more astonishing similarities in store between the Sirius binary system and our own Sun/Mars binary system; although further studies are needed to confirm its existence, it would appear that the Sirius binary system may well harbor a third body – provisionally named “Sirius C”. We shall now take a look at what is currently known about this hotly-debated _third_ component of the Sirius system - and its most fascinating implications (as viewed under the TYCHOS model's proposed configuration of our Solar System). 

A fairly recent (1994) French astrophysical study concluded that there is are strong indications for the existence of "Sirius C":  
[Is Sirius a Triple Star?](https://www.tychos.info/citation/017A_Is-Sirius-Triple-Star.pdf)  
by D. Benest and J.L. Duvent (1994) for _Astronomy and Astrophysics_ 299, 621-628

Before proceeding, let us first look at this diagram of the observed, intersecting orbits of Sirius A and Sirius B:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/SIRIUS_A_and_B_orbit_diagram_01.jpg)

The above diagram shows how modern astronomers have interpreted the relative motions of Sirius A and Sirius B: they both revolve in intersecting orbits around... nothing at all! (or, if you will, 'around their common barycenter'). But what if we place that conjectured "Sirius C" in the middle of Sirius A's orbit? Well, in my below graphic, I show how this would compare with our Sun/Mars binary system:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/SIRIUSSYSTEM_vs_SOLARSYSTEM_01.jpg)

Please note the most remarkable aspect revealed by my above graphic comparison: we know that the Mars-to-Earth distances can vary by a 1-to-7 ratio. Well, this would also be the case if "Sirius C" existed: the SiriusB-to-SiriusC distances would also vary by a 1-to-7 ratio! 


Here follows a simple diagram (author unknown) to be found on various websites depicting a proposed orbital configuration of the Sirius system. It features the elusive “Sirius C” (_a.k.a._ “Emme Tolo”) positioned at the barycenter of the Sirius A / B binary system:

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/017_Sirius_A_B_and_Emme.jpg)

  

Above source — _[The Dogons and the Stars of Sirius](https://www.tychos.info/citation/017B_Pacal-Dogon.htm)_ by Pacal Votan (2007)

“Emme Tolo” is the name given to the elusive (as yet unseen) Sirius C by the Dogons, an ancient African tribe whose culture and religion was based around their inexplicably advanced knowledge of the Sirius system. As it is, some of the Dogons’ astronomical knowledge has been confirmed in modern times, such as, for instance, their astounding estimation of 50 years for the orbital period of the Sirius binary system (today reckoned to be 50.1 y). In fact, it still remains a veritable mystery just how the Dogons even knew of the existence of Sirius B since it is not (currently) visible with the naked eye — but only with large, powerful telescopes.

Amazingly, the Dogons somehow also knew about an even smaller body revolving (in lunar fashion) around “Emme Tolo” (Sirius C) — much like our Moon revolves around Earth. They named this satellite “Nyan Tolo”, which translates as “the Women’s Star”. Of course, our Moon (_la Luna_ in Italian, and in Greek mythology represented by the gorgeous goddess Selene) has always been “the women’s star”, what with its sidereal orbital period of 27.3 days (which more or less matches the average female menstrual cycle).

_[The Dogon Tribe: Connection Sirius](https://www.tychos.info/citation/017C_Dogon-Sirius.htm)_ by Ivan Petricevic (2007)

I don’t wish to dwell too long on the Dogons and their inexplicably-advanced knowledge of the Sirius system, since this whole topic appears to have been, in later years, “sensationalized” and exploited (to generate popular book sales) by a number of authors from the UFO/New Age crowd and submerged by a dross of fanciful conjectures. Suffice to say that we simply don’t know how the ancient Dogon tribe acquired this knowledge. It seems unlikely, however, that this entire Dogon affair is just a figment of someone’s imagination. In any event, if it should turn out that Sirius C (“Emme Tolo”) and its moon (“Nyan Tolo”) both exist, we will certainly have to seriously consider the compelling prospect that the Sirius System is some sort of “**Twin family**” of our own solar system:

| OBJECT  |      TWIN     |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Sirius A | Sun           |
| Sirius B | Mars          |
| Sirius C | Earth         |
| Nyan Tolo| Moon          |

So, once more: would it be “preposterous” to think that Mars is the Sun’s binary companion? Would the (alleged) huge mass of the Sun versus the (alleged) tiny mass of Mars rule out the idea that the two of them are binary companions? According to modern astrophysics, given the _currently-assumed_ masses of Sun and Mars, yes. Nonetheless, I think it is now wise to ask if all of those “mass” assumptions – as imagined by Sir Isaac Newton – have any bearing on the physics of two celestial (binary) bodies revolving around each other.

In conclusion, I submit that the very existence of the Sirius system is strongly supportive of the TYCHOS tenets. It provides empirical evidence that a small celestial body can indeed be the binary companion of a far larger celestial body. Whether the Dogon story is fictitious or not will not change the observable facts.

Next, I will introduce the basic configuration of the TYCHOS system. Although it may seem somewhat premature to unveil it at this early stage I feel it is necessary in order for the reader to get a general overview of the TYCHOS before tackling the successive chapters.
