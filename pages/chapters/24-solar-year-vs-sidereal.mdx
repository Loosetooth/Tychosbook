Chapter 24 - Dayton Miller - and the speed of Earth
===========================================

Dayton Miller has to be one of the most tenacious astronomers of the past century. His relentless quest to try and measure the translational speed of Earth was certainly second to none. As a Copernican, he believed that Earth revolved around the Sun at about 30km/s (or 90X the speed of sound, as of the heliocentric theory), yet his sophisticated interferometer instrument kept 'yielding', over and over again, an apparent velocity that he could only interpret as somewhere between 9 or 10Km/s. Here's what we may read on his Wikipedia page:

> _"Dayton Miller performed over 326,000 turns of interferometer with 16 readings each one, (more than 5,200,000 measurements). They showed what appeared to be a small amount of drift (about 9 km/s, 1/3 of the velocity of the Earth around the Sun)."_

I cannot reasonably include in these pages the full story of his tireless experiments - nor the ensuing, epic controversy involving none other than Albert Einstein - but I can warmly recommend to anyone interested this detailed account of the same by James De Meo:

Suffice to say that that Einstein was extremely worried about Miller’s findings and is quoted as having pronounced the following, dramatic statement:

_“If Dr. Miller’s results should be confirmed, then the special relativity theory, and with it the general theory in its present form, fails. Experiment is the supreme judge. Only the equivalence of inertia and weight remain, which would lead to an essentially different theory.”_

As you may know, Einstein had basically _decreed that the ether does not exist_, that the speed of light is constant independently of the observer, and that - therefore - the orbital speed of Earth is _undetectable and immeasurable._ Miller's repeated non-null results (of 9 or 10 km/s) were thus perceived as a threat to Einstein's 'glorious' relativity theory which, at the time, was in full swing among the scientific community of the time. But let's get on and take a closer look at Dayton Miller's findings - as viewed through the TYCHOS 'lens'. 

In the previous chapter, we saw that "the speed of our Solar System in relation to the stars" is currently estimated at 19.4km/s. We also computed that, under the TYCHOS model's 42633 Reduction Factor, these 19.4km/s (or 69480km/h) 'translate' into: 69480 / 42633 ≈ 1.6km/h - i.e. the proposed orbital speed of Earth in the TYCHOS. 

Earlier on, at the end of chapter 14, I also illustrated the "Mean Variation Coefficient" (MVC) of **0.8 km/h**, which represents the expected rate of oscillation (or acceleration / deceleration) that will affect our perceived motions of ALL of _our Solar System's bodies_ - since they alternately travel in the same - or in the opposite - direction of Earth.   

Now, Dayton Miller was adamant that his interferometer data (and thence extrapolated Earth velocities) consistently indicated a speed of about 9 or 10km/s. Hence, it may seem reasonable to average these two numbers into a mean value of "9.5km/s"(or 34200km/h). As we apply our TYCHOS reduction factor of 42633, we thus obtain:

34200/42633 = **0.802 Km/h**

Is all of this coincidental? Am I perhaps trying too hard to confirm and validate the TYCHOS model's tenets? Maybe. However, let's earnestly proceed on this line of thought and see if we can find other indications in support of my proposed MVC of 0.8 km/h.

Let's now fast-forward in time to a most fascinating French paper authored in 2007 by Pierre Fuerxer, titled [“Les expériences optiques et la relativité”](http://allais.maurice.free.fr/EtudeFuerxer.pdf). Fuerxer is a biographer of the eminent physicist-cum-economist Maurice Allais (1911-2010). Aside from his 1988 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Allais is famed for having falsified Einstein’s Theory of Relativity - in a most articulate and authoritative manner. He did so by performing a profound examination of Dayton Miller's vast and rigorous body of research. In short, what Maurice Allais determined was that Miller’s findings could certainly not be dismissed as “spurious” (as Miller's influential opponents had done) due to their solid statistical coherence and consistency.
