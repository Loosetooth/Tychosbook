Dayton Miller has to be one of the most tenacious astronomers of the past century. His relentless quest to try and measure the translational speed of Earth was certainly second to none. As a Copernican, he believed that Earth revolved around the Sun at about 30km/s (or 90X the speed of sound, as of the heliocentric theory), yet his sophisticated interferometer instrument kept 'yielding', over and over again, an apparent velocity that he could only interpret as somewhere between 9 or 10Km/s. Here's what we may read on his Wikipedia page:

> _"Dayton Miller performed over 326,000 turns of interferometer with 16 readings each one, (more than 5,200,000 measurements). They showed what appeared to be a small amount of drift (about 9 km/s, 1/3 of the velocity of the Earth around the Sun)."_

I cannot reasonably include in these pages the full story of his tireless experiments - nor the ensuing, epic controversy involving none other than Albert Einstein - but I can warmly recommend to anyone interested this detailed account of the same by James De Meo:

Suffice to say that that Einstein was extremely worried about Miller’s findings and is quoted as having pronounced the following, 'dramatic' statement:

**_“If Dr. Miller’s results should be confirmed, then the special relativity theory, and with it the general theory in its present form, fails. Experiment is the supreme judge. Only the equivalence of inertia and weight remain, which would lead to an essentially different theory.”_**

As you may know, Einstein had basically _decreed that the ether does not exist_, that the speed of light is constant independently of the observer, and that - therefore - the orbital speed of Earth is _undetectable and immeasurable._ Miller's repeated non-null results (of 9 or 10 km/s) were thus perceived as a threat to Einstein's 'glorious' relativity theory which, at the time, was in full swing among the scientific community of the time. But let's get on and take a closer look at Dayton Miller's findings - as viewed through the TYCHOS 'lens'. 

In the previous chapter, we saw that "the speed of our Solar System in relation to the stars" is currently estimated at 19.4km/s. We also computed that, under the TYCHOS model's 42633 Reduction Factor, these 19.4km/s (or 69480km/h) 'translate' into: 69480 / 42633 ≈ 1.6km/h - i.e. the proposed orbital speed of Earth in the TYCHOS. 

Earlier on, at the end of chapter 14, I also illustrated the "Mean Variation Coefficient" (MVC) of **0.8 km/h**, which represents the expected rate of oscillation (or acceleration / deceleration) that will affect our perceived motions of ALL of _our Solar System's bodies_ - since they alternately travel in the same - or in the opposite - direction of Earth.   

Now, Dayton Miller was adamant that his interferometer data (and thence extrapolated Earth velocities) consistently indicated a speed of about 9 or 10km/s. Hence, it may seem reasonable to average these two numbers into a mean value of "9.5km/s"(or 34200km/h). As we apply our TYCHOS reduction factor of 42633, we thus obtain:

34200/42633 = **0.802 Km/h** (i.e. almost precisely the MVC-value proposed by the TYCHOS model)

Is all of this coincidental? Am I perhaps trying too hard to confirm and validate the TYCHOS model's tenets? Maybe. However, let's earnestly proceed on this line of thought and see if we can find other indications in support of my proposed MVC of 0.8 km/h (i.e. half of Earth's orbital speed of 1.6km/h)

Let's now fast-forward in time to a most fascinating French paper authored in 2007 by Pierre Fuerxer, titled [“Les expériences optiques et la relativité”](http://allais.maurice.free.fr/EtudeFuerxer.pdf). Fuerxer is a biographer of the eminent physicist-cum-economist Maurice Allais (1911-2010). Aside from his 1988 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Allais is famed for having falsified Einstein’s Theory of Relativity - in a most articulate and authoritative manner. He did so by performing a profound examination of Dayton Miller's vast and rigorous body of research. In short, what Maurice Allais determined was that Miller’s findings could certainly not be dismissed as “spurious” (as Miller's influential opponents had done) due to their solid statistical coherence and consistency. 

Here is an extract from the Maurice Allais Foundation's website:

Now, as I have highlighted in the above screenshot, Dayton Miller was seeing _“diurnal variations in the speed of light of an amplitude of about 8 km/h”._ This “8 km/h” variation in the diurnal speed of light immediately caught my attention. Could this value possibly be “off” by one decimal? Was that 'diurnal variation' perhaps 0,8km/h - instead of 8km/h?

Well, as I reached the end of Fuerxer’s paper about Dayton Miller's experiments, I found this most fascinating statement. To appreciate its full significance, you must know that the most _popularly-known_ interferometer experiments (those of Michelson and Morley) were dismissed as having yielded "NULL" results. This is simply not true: the results of several other interferometer experiments showed _similar and comparable results_.  

> _“Tous les interféromètres de Michelson dont le schéma optique est celui de l’interféromètre initial ont donné des résultats comparables.”_

**“All Michelson-type experiments using the optical scheme of his original interferometer have yielded comparable results.”**

![](http://septclues.com/TYCHOS/Interferometers_fringe_VALUES_01.jpg)

The results of most of the various Michelson-type experiments performed over the years have showed a speed-of-light variation of around 8 x 10-10, whereas two other particularly accurate experiments by Roy Kennedy and Esclangon yielded a marginally smaller value: 7 x 10-10. All in all, they pretty much agreed with each other. This flies straight in the face of the “widely accepted” notion that the many interferometer experiments yielded “null” results.

To clarify, in “scientific annotation”, 8 x 10-10 simply means 0.0000000008 (of the speed of light), while 7 x 10-10 simply means 0.0000000007 (of the speed of light). For the sake of the following calculus, I will use the average value of these two figures: 0.00000000075.

Speed of light: 299,792.5km/s

299,792.5km/s x 0.00000000075 = 0.000224844km/s

Converting km/s to km/h, we have 0.000224844 x 3600 = **0.809439 km/h.** 

Once more, this is very close to my 0.8 km/h MVC (“Mean Variation Coefficient”)

DISCLAIMER: I will now candidly (and humbly) state what follows: I have little or no idea as to how exactly the many interferometer experiments were carried out - nor much less how the data thereof was computed into given velocity values that would have, supposedly, represented the 'true' orbital / translational speed of Earth around the Sun. However, if my own extrapolations of the available data are completely invalid, then we must assume that the fact that they appear to support the tenets of the TYCHOS model are entirely coincidental.
