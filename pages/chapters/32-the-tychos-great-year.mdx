Chapter 32 - 
==============================================================================

It is a most unfortunate fact that Tycho Brahe’s and Pathani Samanta’s laborious contributions to astronomy have been all but obliterated from history in spite of their excellence and substantial validity. The Tychos model emphatically revives and vindicates their lifetime efforts - along with those of other industrious scientists whose work was either misunderstood, overlooked or simply ignored. I suggest that the time has come to do them justice and to reassess the configuration of our Solar System with a fresh and earnest outlook - free from heliocentric, relativist or Newtonian preconceptions. 

Needless to say, vigorous resistance to the paradigm-shifting Tychos model is to be fully expected - not least from academic circles, known for their abhorrence of new ideas that may challenge their venerated "icons of science" - and thus threaten their long-established, "untouchable Laws". However, I dare say that the "ball" (i.e. the burden of proof concerning the true configuration of our Solar System) now lies squarely in the heliocentrists' court. In any event, I can only hope that the Tychos model may be carefully considered and reviewed (by earnest scholars and laymen alike), so as to start a collective and constructive intellectual debate among the inquisitive sons and daughters of Mother Earth. 

May reason prevail.
