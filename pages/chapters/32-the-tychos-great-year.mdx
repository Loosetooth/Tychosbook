Chapter 32 - Epilogue / may reason prevail
==============================================================================

It is a most unfortunate fact that Tycho Brahe’s and Pathani Samanta’s laborious contributions to astronomy have been virtually obliterated from history in spite of their observational excellence and substantial validity. The Tychos model emphatically revives and vindicates their lifetime efforts - along with those of other industrious scientists whose work was either misunderstood, overlooked or simply ignored. I suggest that the time has come to do them justice - and to reassess the configuration of our Solar System with a fresh and earnest outlook - free from heliocentric, relativist or Newtonian preconceptions. Needless to say, vigorous resistance to the paradigm-shifting Tychos model is to be fully expected - primarily from academic circles, notoriously impervious to (and dismissive of) new ideas that may challenge their venerated icons of science - and their "untouchable, long-established Laws" ground in stone. However, I dare say that the "ball" - i.e. the burden of proof concerning the true configuration of our Solar System - now lies squarely in the heliocentrists' court. 

One may say that the Copernican model’s upside-down heliocentric view has mesmerized humanity for the last four centuries or so, if not just as an opposition to geocentrism. The refutation of one inadequate theory for another ignited along its way the Mother of all circular debates among the sharpest minds of this planet. Those debates were, essentially, destined to fail so long as the sacrosanct, universally-worshipped science priesthood remained unchallenged about their unshakeable heliocentric convictions. To question today the likes of Galileo, Kepler, Newton and Copernicus (or even Einstein) is tantamount to _heresy_ among much of modern academia; this stagnant state of affairs, as you may agree, is not conducive (and is even detrimental) to the advancement of human knowledge.

Only a few centuries ago, scientists and astronomers all over the world were engaging in vivid, bitter and passionate battles in the quest for the most plausible “cosmo-logical” configuration of our solar system. What most people tend to forget is precisely what, at the time, was at stake. Mind you, it was likely a largely unspoken truism even back then, but what was imperilled was no less than the very survival of the (already widely-embraced) Copernican model - and its status as the “end-all” of all cosmic models. 

Countless experiments were being feverishly carried out, one more intricate than the other - and all of them shared the same objective: to scientifically verify and establish beyond reasonable doubt that Earth was hurtling around space (and around the Sun) at the staggering, hypersonic speed of 107,226 km/h (i.e. "Mach 90") - as contended by the Copernican, heliocentric theory. It was a most extraordinary claim that, necessarily, had to be scientifically verified. Failure was not an option for its illustrious proponents.

Yet today, the most famous series of such experiments - the Michelson-Morley interferometer studies — are billed as the _“most failed scientific experiments of all time”._ Mind you, they really don’t deserve to be singled out for having fallen short of proving Copernicus right; it is a matter of historical record that _all_ other similar experiments utterly and completely fell short of proving Earth’s purported, hypersonic orbital motion around the Sun. Despite designs to prove heliocentrism, experimental data continued to tell us what we refused to hear.

Another intense series of experiments were those attempting to determine stellar parallax. Of course, this was also a crucial test for the Copernican model: if no stellar parallax whatsoever could be detected, then the Copernican theory had to be categorically discarded. Instead, after decades of painstaking efforts by eminent astronomers around the world, some minute/microscopic stellar parallax was finally detected. Incredibly enough (and here’s where one must question the intellectual integrity of the world’s scientific community), those infinitesimal star displacements were deemed sufficient to prove that Earth moves at hypersonic speeds around space - completing an almost 1-billion-km-long (and 300 Mkm-wide) orbit every year!

Of course, the official explanation offered by apologists for this near-zero stellar parallax was that _“the stars are far, far, far more distant than anyone had ever imagined!”_ Amazingly, it has never occurred to anyone that, since some stars are claimed to be “only” 4 or 5 light years away — while other stars (visually adjacent to those closer stars) are claimed to be several thousands of light years away - we should most definitely be able to detect some quite substantial parallax between such closer and much more distant stars (that is, if Earth were revolving around the Sun along a 300 Mkm-wide orbit). The TYCHOS model — with its 1 mph earthly motion — provides a plain, intuitively sound and logical solution to this age-old riddle: The observed stellar parallaxes are so very, very small simply because our tranquil Mother Earth moves very little each year, and slower than the pace of an evening walk around the village.

Still today, no one really knows exactly how distant the stars are. Just consider this quite recent (2012) science journal’s announcement: _“A scientific astronomy study has determined that Polaris, our North Star, is approximately 1/3 closer to Earth than previously thought.”_ So much for the much-vaunted “pinpoint accuracy” of astronomical data! You may agree that such a radical revision of this fundamental stellar distance is almost comical: if our modern astronomers cannot even agree on the Earth->Polaris distance (which is used as a cosmological yardstick to measure all other star distances), what credibility can any officially-claimed stellar distances possibly retain?

> _"The North Star has been a guiding light for countless generations of navigators. But a new study reveals that its distance to Earth may have been grossly overestimated. In fact, the North Star — also called Polaris — is 30 percent closer to our solar system than previously thought, at about 323 light-years away, according to an international team who studied the star's light output.(...) The star is also a type of cosmological yardstick used by researchers to measure great cosmic distances out to billions of light-years."_ [North Star closer than thought - National Geographic](https://www.tychos.info/citation/003C_North-Star-Closer.htm)

Perhaps the most tragicomical instance of cosmic science-quackery is Arthur Eddington’s solar eclipse experiment in 1919. At the time, the fundamental tenets of both the Copernican and the Newtonian theories were perilously at stake, since the observed orbital behaviour of Mercury “refused” to comply with Newton’s Laws. So the Royal Society dispatched Sir Eddington to Gabon, Africa - and another team to South America - to photograph an upcoming solar eclipse. Arthur’s expedition almost ended in dire disaster, as the skies were cloudy most of the time, yet his team somehow managed to snap a couple of (blurry) shots of the eclipse. The South American team did better and brought home a few half-decent shots of the 1919 solar eclipse. Now, the whole point of the exercise was to confirm the validity of a young upstart scientist’s thesis, namely the “theory of relativity”. The then little-known Albert Einstein had “come to the rescue” of both Newton’s and Copernicus’ endangered theories, basically stating that, “The light emitted by a celestial body will bend / warp - in the vicinity of a large mass such as the Sun.” In other words, “You can’t trust what you see with your own eyes; Mercury may seem to be where you see it but in reality it is elsewhere!” To make a long story short, even though the photographic plates snapped by the two Royal Society teams presented conflicting and utterly inconclusive data, Sir Eddington somehow managed to pass them off as “definitive and irrefutable proof of Einstein’s relativity theory”! After which Einstein became, almost overnight, the universally-acclaimed celebrity that he still is today.

Another droll (yet cringingly contrived) effort aimed at confirming the Copernican model was that of Sir James Bradley, the man who invented “Stellar Aberration” _see Chapter 22)_. Bradley had been observing the motions of star Draconis for several months with a telescope mounted in his home’s chimney near London. As we have seen, his observations of Draconis’ seasonal motions turned out to be totally conflicting with the predictions of the Copernican model. Yet, instead of bringing into question the core priciples of heliocentrism (and returning to the drawing board - as any earnest scientist would have done), Bradley concocted the most contorted astronomical theory of them all, namely his “Stellar Aberration” theory. Amazingly, Bradley’s mental concoction is still held by academia as the _“conclusive proof of Earth's motion around the Sun”_.  

All in all, we may conclude that the Copernican theory has benefited, over the last centuries, from a steady flow of confirmation bias (the very 'nemesis' of the scientific method). And so, here we are today; the Copernican theory is safely shielded in its unassailable ivory tower - unquestioned by almost everyone - whilst the long string of embarrassing failures to confirm its core tenets have faded away from public memory - or been erased by misguided or deliberate efforts. 

May coming generations thrive in the blissful serenity enjoyed by our planet as it gently sails around space, embraced by the Sun-Mars binary system, at the safe and comfortable speed of 1 mph. Also - as a final, heartfelt aspiration - may the Tychos model be carefully appraised and reviewed (by earnest scholars and laymen alike), so as to start a collective and constructive debate among the inquisitive and intellectually-unshackled sons and daughters of Mother Earth. 

May reason prevail.
