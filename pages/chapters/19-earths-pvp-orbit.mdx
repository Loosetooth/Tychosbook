
Chapter 19 — Our “Leap Day”: what is it for?
=========================================================================


You may have asked yourself at some stage in your life, “How can our calendar possibly have an **integer** value of 365 days (or 366 days on a leap year) whereas, on the other hand, we are told that one year lasts ca. 365.25 days (i.e. 365 days + 6 hours?)”

Does this mean that, from one year to the next, Earth ends up skewed by 1/4 of a rotation, or 90°?

Of course not. Yet, everyone knows that we add 1 day every 4 years in order to get a 4-year-sequence of 365 + 365 + 365 + 366 = 1461/4 = 365.25 (or more precisely, 365.2425 - as defined by the Gregorian calendar - as some leap years are being periodically skipped). Here are some 'explanations' for the 4-year occurrence of February 29: “[February 29](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_February_29.pdf)” from Wikipedia.

> _“In the Gregorian calendar, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100, 2200, and 2300. Conversely, 1600 and 2000 did and 2400 will.”_

My below sequence shows ad absurdum the implication of the well-known notion that “a year actually lasts for 365.**25** days”.

Obviously, we do not end up skewed by 6 hours at the completion of a year. Thus, we may legitimately ask ourselves:_“Where do these 6 hours come from?”_ Can the Copernican model account for them, and can the reason for their existence be visually illustrated in a heliocentric graphic? The short answer to this last question is: No.

On the other hand, the TYCHOS model can illustrate the probable motive for astronomers to have stipulated that a year lasts for about 6 hours (or ¼ of a day) more than 365 integer days.

Astronomers have observed over the centuries that the **maximal** annual displacement of a given star on the ecliptic (currently 50.29” arcseconds per year) occurs between point “A” and point “B” (as marked in my above graphic). So, every year, 6 hours are considered to be “lost in space”. Therefore, they have concluded that _“one sidereal year lasts for 365.25 days”_ (or more precisely 365.25636 days).

However, we may also read in the Wikipedia’s entry on the [“Sothic cycle”](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Sothic_cycle.pdf):

> “The Sidereal year of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the ecliptic (the apparent path of the sun across the sky).”

Now, every calendar year (of 365 days), we see the Sun “slipping backwards” against the starry background by about 1 minute of RA. Every four years, this adds up to about 4 minutes of “lost ground” on the part of the Sun. 4 minutes is just about the same amount of RA that the Sun advances by each day (more precisely, 3.93 minutes). Therefore, by (the Gregorian calendar’s) convention, one extra leap day, February 29, is added to make up for the Sun’s lost ground.

As viewed under the TYCHOS model, this makes perfect sense. Since the Sun travels at 107,226 km/h, in 3.93 minutes it will cover a distance of approximately **7023** km which is about half the distance traveled by Earth annually (14,035.85 km). This means that, every 4 years, the Gregorian calendar’s leap-day-gimmick allows the Sun to “regain” about _half of its accumulated offset_ caused by Earth’s motion.

A further complexity which should be mentioned is that this forward leap (of 7023 km) conceded to the Sun every four years by our current Gregorian year-count is a tiny bit too long. It will therefore slowly, over time, let the Sun drift too far Eastwards (_i.e.;_ in the _opposed direction_ of Earth’s motion). This will eventually (in 25344 years) cause the Sun to "slip out of synch" with Earth (as will be illustrated further on).

In short, the reason why we cannot divide our solar year in 365 integer days is due to Earth's 1-mph-motion around its PVP orbit.
