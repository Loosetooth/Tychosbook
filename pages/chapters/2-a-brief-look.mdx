Chapter 1 — A brief historical overview of Solar System models
==========================================================================

Perhaps the first thing that ought to be clarified / or reminded (for the readers of this book) is the definition of the three main configurations of our Solar System proposed and relentlessly debated among astronomers across the centuries. I will do so in an extremely succint and simplified fashion:

1) GEOCENTRISM: The idea that Earth is in the centre of our Solar System (or our Universe) and that everything revolves around Earth - including the stars. 

2) HELIOCENTRISM: The idea that the Sun is in the centre of our Solar System and that all of our planets (including Earth) revolve around the Sun.

3) GEOHELIOCENTRISM: The idea that Earth is in the centre of our Solar System and that all of our planets (but Earth) revolve around the Sun.

N°1 is the old (and long-abandoned) Ptolemaic / Aristotelian model. It has been effectively and definitively disproven via empirical observation. 
N°2 is of course the currently-accepted configuration (i.e. the Copernican / Keplerian model). It requires Earth to be moving at 90X the speed of sound.
N°3 is the model proposed by Tycho Brahe (and others). Although equally valid as N°2, it is currently ignored & dismissed by the world's scientific community.  
 
It is a little-known fact that Tycho Brahe's model was, at the time, the most widely-accepted theory of our Solar System's configuration - and remained so for at least one century after his death (in 1601). On the other hand, the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus struggled for many decades to attain some sort of recognition among the world's scientific community - due to its many bizarre and extraordinary claims. 
 
Let us now compare the proposed geoheliocentric models of two exceptional observational astronomers of yore, both of which (unwittigly) reached similar conclusions as to the geometric configuration of our Solar System.  

Below is a page that I scanned from a book titled _"Indian Mathematics and Astronomy"_. The book was graciously given to me by its author (as I visited him in Bangalore, India, in April 2016); namely Prof. Balachandra Rao, a now-retired professor of mathematics, astronomy historian and author of several captivating books on ancient Indian astronomy. The page features an illustration of the planetary model designed by Pathani Samanta, a man rightly heralded as India’s greatest naked-eye astronomer of all times:

As you can see, the models of these two outstanding observational astronomers are perfectly identical. I have highlighted (in yellow and red) the intersecting orbits of the Sun and Mars which, clearly, are consistent with what we would call today a binary pair.

Since Tycho predated Pathani by more than two centuries, one might suspect some plagiarism on the part of the latter. However, it appears to be well-documented that Pathani Samanta (who published a monumental work in Sanskrit, the “Sidhanta Darpana”) reached his conclusions through his very own observations and ingenuity, working in semi-seclusion and with little or no contact with the Western world for most of his lifetime. I find it most unlikely that Samanta simply plagiarized Brahe’s work. Conversely, one could perhaps just as well suspect Brahe of having 'snatched' some ideas from another illustrious Indian astronomer/mathematician; namely, Nilakantha Somayaji (1444-1544) who predated Brahe by a century or so and who first devised a geoheliocentric system where all the planets - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth. However, there can be no doubt as to the legitimacy of Brahe's massive body of astronomical observations - and their unprecedented accuracy. So let’s leave this at that, and instead ask ourselves a far more interesting question implied by the above-illustrated identical models of Tycho Brahe and Pathani Samanta:

_“How and why did such diverse astronomers, after lifetimes of painstaking research, eventually reach such strikingly similar conclusions, independently of each other?”_

Furthermore, as we take a closer look at them, there is one thing in both illustrations that intuitively appears to be missing. If you are game, please pause your reading for one minute and ask yourself: _what geometric shape (that should logically be there) is absent in both of the above planetary models?_ Give it a good thought and continue reading when inspired to do so.

Well, here is what - in my view - constitutes a major 'improbability' in the above models: notice that the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun all have circular orbital paths drawn in the model. Only _one_ celestial body is, uniquely, lacking an orbit. That’s right: **Earth!** Now, why would our planet _not_ have an orbit, unlike all of the bodies in our Solar System - and indeed, unlike ALL the celestial bodies in our Universe? As I see it, the idea that Earth – and Earth only – would remain completely immobile in space is a most unfortunate failure of imagination. Nonetheless, the highest praise goes to these two great astronomers of yore who provided us the most significant clue of all: namely, that the Sun and Mars are, in fact, “interlocked” in typical (intersecting) binary orbits, just like the vast majority - or perhaps ALL - of our surrounding star systems.
