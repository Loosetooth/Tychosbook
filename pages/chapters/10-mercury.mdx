  Chapter 10 — Requiem for the “Lunisolar Wobble” theory
======================================================

Does Earth’s polar axis wobble? Can the "Lunisolar" theory be demonstrated empirically? Not a chance in Heaven. Let us see why.

According to the Copernican “Lunisolar” theory, Earth’s equinoctial precession is caused by a slow 360° 'reverse' wobble of Earth’s polar axis which requires about 25,000 or 26,000 years to be completed. As the theory goes, this slow 'retrograde rotation' (which would proceed in the opposite direction of Earth’s axial rotation) is due to some combined gravitational forces generated by the Moon and the Sun (hence “Luni/Solar”) - somehow acting upon the oblateness of planet Earth. To be sure, it is still today upheld by academia as a firmly established scientific fact, in spite of the many glaring problems afflicting its fundamental tenets - as conclusively demonstrated in later decades by a number of independent authors.


Two conventional illustrations of the so-called “Lunisolar wobble” (a.k.a. "the Third Motion of Earth")

Let us recall that the Copernican model _necessarily_ requires three distinct motions of Earth in order for it to 'work':   

1\. Earth’s (“anticlockwise”) daily rotation around its polar axis

2\. Earth’s (“anticlockwise”) 107,226km/h-motion around the Sun

3\. Earth's ("clockwise") extremely slow retrograde wobble of its polar axis 

Hence, the “Third Motion of Earth” always was an _essential prerequisite for the Copernican theory’s very survival_, since it was meant to account for the observable fact that the stars precess (or “drift Eastwards” - in relation to Earth’s equinoctial axis) by about 50 arcseconds per year - thereby causing our Pole stars to change over time. 

However - and most dramatically - this Copernican excuse simply doesn’t hold up to close scrutiny. What is known today as the “Precession Paradox” is best summarized in the following statement by Walter Cruttenden, whose Binary Research Institute has thoroughly exposed the untenable tenets of the so-called “Lunisolar” theory:

> **“Precession only occurs relative to objects outside the solar system – the Earth does not precess or change orientation relative to objects within the solar system.”**

— p.8, _[Comparison of Precession Theories: An Argument for the Binary Mode](https://www.tychos.info/citation/075C_Comparison-of-Precession.pdf)_ by Walter Cruttenden (August 12, 2003)

Cruttenden (and a number of other independent authors) have dealt a mortal blow to the Lunisolar theory. Hence, as incredible as it may seem, the all-important “precession of the equinoxes” remains to this day a wide-open question: it is a cosmic mystery still awaiting for a sound and rational explanation.

Here follow some quotes and links to other papers expounding the insurmountable problems with the Lunisolar wobble theory.

> “Lunisolar wobble required the pole to move by about one degree every 71.5 years based on the current precession rate, hence the pole should have moved about 6 degrees since the Gregorian Calendar change (420 years ago), thereby causing the equinox to drift about 5.9 days. This has not happened; the equinox is stable in time after making leap adjustments.”

> “When Earth spins on its axis in West to East direction (Anti clockwise) it is natural that North Pole of the axis moves in the same direction. It is how North Pole can describe a circle of precession about star Polaris in a clockwise direction opposite to the natural rotation of North Pole of the axis conspicuously that remains unexplained. The hypothesis of Earth’s wobble does not explain above contradiction. Hence, the hypothetical proposition that the retrograde motion of North Pole is due to Earth’s wobble is not credible.”

> “If the slow wobble of Earth’s axis causes the precession of the equinoxes, it is a product of shifting perspective and should affect everything we view from Earth. Some astronomers argue that objects within our solar system do not appear to precess. Only objects outside of the solar system do. If this is the case, then the Earth’s wobble cannot be the cause of precessional movement.”

> “The Earth’s changing orientation to inertial space (as required by any binary orbit of our Sun), can be seen as Precession of the Equinox. This fact has been masked by the illusion called the lunisolar explanation for precession.”

— [_Understanding Precession of the Equinox: Evidence our Sun is part of a Long Cycle Binary Star System_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/099B_BRI-Evidence.pdf) by Walter Cruttenden and Vince Dayes (2003)

> “In summary, a number of independent groups, all studying the same problem of lunisolar mechanics have concluded that precession is most likely caused by something other than a local wobbling of the Earth.”

— p.2, _[Comparison of Precession Theories: An Argument for the Binary Mode](https://www.tychos.info/citation/075C_Comparison-of-Precession.pdf)_ by Walter Cruttenden (August 12, 2003)

Tycho Brahe rightly predicted that the “triple motion” of Earth, as proposed by Copernicus, would be refuted.

> “The Copernican system, \[Tycho Brahe\] proclaimed, with its ‘triple motion of the earth will be unquestionably refuted, not simply theologically and physically, but even mathematically, even though Copernicus hoped that he had proposed to mathematicians sufficiently mathematical statements to which they could not object’.”

— _[Tycho Brahe’s critique of Copernicus and the Copernican system](https://www.tychos.info/citation/076F_Brahes-Critique.pdf)_ by Ann Blair, Journal of the History of Ideas 51(3): 355-377 (1990)

It is ironic that Copernicus is often hailed as the man who “simplified” and "elegantly resolved" the complex riddle of our cosmic motions, while the models of Ptolemy and Brahe were dismissed as "too complex" just because, according to some critics, they (allegedly) required too many different motions of our solar system’s bodies.

Here is a graphic (from [this Italian Wikipedia page](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Precessione_degli_equinozi.pdf) illustrating those “simple & elegant” earthly motions that the Copernican theory requires:

Note that the white clockwise arrows represent the so-called “Lunisolar precession”, while the other arrows represent all the other motions piled onto Earth to "explain" the true motions of our system. Enough to make you dizzy, is it not? One can only wonder why the Copernican “Lunisolar” theory was accepted by the world’s scientific community in the first place, and how it can possibly have remained unquestioned and unchallenged for so many centuries.

Most people will be familiar with the old Occam’s-razor-inspired adage that states that “the simplest explanation for some phenomenon is more likely to be true than more complicated explanations.” Evidently, such elementary wisdom was lost on the proponents of Copernicus’s heliocentric theory. Indeed, the idea of Earth slowly wobbling around its polar axis in the opposed direction of its very rotation doesn’t conform to any physical phenomenon known to humankind.




As we shall see, the TYCHOS model requires no more than two terrestrial motions:

1\. Earth’s (“anticlockwise”) daily rotation around its polar axis

2\. Earth’s (“clockwise”) 1 mph-motion around its “PVP” orbit
