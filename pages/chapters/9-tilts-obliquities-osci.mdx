Chapter 9: Tilts, obliquities and oscillations
============================================================

Earth’s well-known 23.4° axial tilt is, of course, a fundamental requisite for the Copernican model to work, since Earth’s obliquity is meant to account for our alternating seasons. The most popularly-held, yet academically-supported theory as to exactly why Earth’s axis would be skewed at an angle goes like this:

> _“When an object the size of Mars crashed into the newly formed planet Earth around 4.5 billion years ago, it knocked our planet over and left it tilted at an angle.”_

— ["What Is Earth’s Axial Tilt or Obliquity?" - Time and Date website](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/axial-tilt-obliquity.html) 

Yet - and in spite of such a fanciful 'explanation' for Earth's tilt - Copernicans also believe that our planet slowly wobbles around its axis... Anyhow, in the TYCHOS, Earth is also tilted at 23.4° in relation to its orbital plane, yet with some notable differences: it is the Sun that revolves around the Earth, while our planet’s own orbital motion slowly proceeds (at the tranquil speed of 1.6 km/h) with our Northern hemisphere 'leaning outwards' (i.e.; towards the Sun’s external orbital path) at all times.

Interestingly, it appears to be beyond dispute (among geophysicists) that our planet’s Northern hemisphere is much “heavier” than its Southern hemisphere. It is estimated that 68% of the Earth’s land exists in the Northern Hemisphere, while 32% is located in the Southern Hemisphere, meaning that our planet is "top heavy". In any event, it is a notion seemingly agreed upon by mainstream and ‘dissident’ scientists alike:

> _“The northern hemisphere consists of the great land masses and higher elevations, from a mechanical aspect, the Earth is top heavy, the northern hemisphere must attract a stronger pull from the Sun than the southern hemisphere. This lack of uniformity should impact on the movements of the Earth.”_

— ["Big Bang or Big Bluff" (p.164) - by Hans Binder (2011)](https://tinyurl.com/bigbangBinder) 

It would thus seem intuitively logical, even to devout Newtonian advocates, that Earth’s heavier hemisphere would hang “outwards” as our planet circles around its own orbit. Conversely, it is hard to fathom how and why Earth’s axis would maintain its fixed, peculiar inclination while circling around the Sun (whilst also slowly wobbling around its axis) as of heliocentric theory. In fact, one of the latter’s most problematic aspects has to be its proposed cause for the observed secular stellar precession and our alternating pole stars. As will be expounded in Chapter 10, the hypothesized existence of Earth’s “Third motion” (i.e. a slow, _retrograde_ 'wobble' of Earth’s polar axis) has been roundly disproved in recent years.

As illustrated in my next graphic, the TYCHOS provides an uncomplicated solution to account for the General Precession and our alternating pole stars: it it simply due to the Earth’s slow, 'clockwise' motion around what I have called the “PVP orbit” (Polaris-Vega-Polaris), one such PVP orbit being completed  in 25344 years. Our current Northern and Southern pole stars are Polaris and Sigma Octantis, but over time they will be replaced by other stars - such as Vega (ca. 11000 years from now) and Eta Columba (ca. 12000 years from now).

The fact that Earth is tilted in such manner may possibly also go to explain why the Sun is further from Earth around July - and closer to Earth around January (the difference is 152.1Mkm - 147.1Mkm = **5Mkm** - or a 3.3% difference). As a matter of fact, the Sun is observed to be about 3.3% smaller in July than in January - as viewed from **both** of Earth's hemispheres (incidentally, one wonders how flat earth proponents would account for _this_ particular empirical observation!):

Now, if we instead envision the Earth's magnetic charge as a ‘repelling’ force (which, so-to-speak, “keeps the Sun from falling into it”), it would make sense that this repulsion peaks around the NH summer solstice – when our ‘heavier’ Northern Hemisphere is maximally tilted towards the Sun (see below graphic). In the NH winter solstice - when the Southern Hemisphere is mostly tilted towards the Sun - this repulsion wanes somewhat, allowing the Sun to get a little closer to Earth (by 5Mkm). However speculative this 'magnetic' explanation for the Earth's axial tilt may be, I nonetheless find it worthwhile to consider - were it only as a stimulus for future inquiry:

In any event, this variation between 152 Mkm and 147 Mkm (a **3.3% difference**) would help explain why Kepler strangely concluded that all the bodies in our Solar System keep accelerating and decelerating. According to Kepler’s ‘laws’, as Earth travels around the Sun, it alternately speeds up and slows down; in the TYCHOS, of course, the Sun ‘substitutes’ the Earth as the annually orbiting body: the below orbital velocities (officially attributed to the Earth) would thus apply to the Sun.

According to a NASA Fact Sheet: 

EARTH’s max. orbital velocity: 30.29 km/s

EARTH’s min. orbital velocity: 29.29 km/s

Ergo, a **3.3% difference**… How interesting: we just saw that the Sun-Earth distance fluctuates by 3.3% !

Note that this is no small variation: it means Earth would be traveling as much as 3600 km/h faster (i.e. about 3 times the speed of sound) in January than it does in July! You may now rightly ask: _”how are such hefty (yet formidably stable & immutable) speed variations explained?”_ Well, this is claimed to be due to the Sun’s ’gravitational pull’: the closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it will travel – and vice versa... 

However, one has to wonder what sort of uncanny forces would cause the Sun’s "gravitational pull" (exerted _perpendicularly_ to a given planet's orbit) to cause it to speed up and slow down, _linearly_! Yet, this is what Kepler was forced to conclude – in order to "make things work". Anyhow, I trust that the astute reader has already sensed the plain and obvious explanation for these _apparent_ velocity fluctuations: quite simply, since the Sun transits 3.3% closer to Earth in January (perigee) than it does in July (apogee), it will _be perceived_ to travel 3.3% faster (against the star background). In reality though, the Sun always travels at _constant / invariable_ speed (29.78 km/s) and so do all the bodies in our Solar System. In other words, their apparent orbital speed variations are illusory - and are just a matter of relative distances and spatial perspective. 

### VENUS - AND THE SUN'S 5Mkm OSCILLATION

What follows is something that will require the reader to return to later on (in a second reading) - in order to fully appreciate its remarkable nature and significance. For now, suffice to say that the TYCHOS model submits that Earth's orbital diameter is 113.2Mkm (i.e. the width of the "PVP orbit" which will be expounded in Chapter 11). Venus is, of course, often referred to as "the Earth's sister" - since its dimensions are almost identical to the Earth (Ø of Venus: 12103.6km - and Ø of the Earth: 12756km). Now, as illustrated above, the Earth-Sun distance varies by about 5Mkm between winter and summer - and the _average_ Sun-Venus distance (according to all official estimates) is 108.2Mkm. Well, since Venus is a moon of the Sun (as posited by the TYCHOS), it will also oscillate (in relation to the Earth) by 5Mkm between summer and winter. In other words, the _maximal_ Earth-Venus distance would thus add up to 108.2Mkm + 5Mkm, for a total of 113.2Mkm - i.e. by an amount that would seem to "reflect" the diameter of Earth's "PVP orbit" (as proposed by the TYCHOS)! The significance of this is unclear, yet it would certainly appear to merit further investigation.        

### THE SUN'S 'MYSTERIOUS' 6 (OR 7) DEGREE TILT

> _“It’s such a deep-rooted mystery and so difficult to explain that people just don’t talk about it.”_

You may have never heard of it, but one of the most baffling mysteries in astronomy is the 6° (or 7°) tilt of the Sun — or, as some have it, what is actually tilted is the “common plane of all of our planets’ orbits with respect to the Sun's polar axis”. Make no mistake: the observable fact that the Sun’s axis is tilted at an angle (with respect to the entire Solar System’s plane) is no petty matter. For why would this be? Isn’t the Sun supposed to be the massive, “central driveshaft” of our system? Shouldn’t therefore all our planets' orbits be co-planar with the Sun’s equator? Well, they are not - and this fact is an absolute mystery for academic astronomy, an unresolved quandary which all by itself falsifies both Newton’s and Einstein's edicts. As recently as 2016, an academic study admitted that it’s _“such a deep-rooted mystery and so difficult to explain that people just don’t talk about it”_. The study went on bizarrely to speculate that this tilt of the Sun’s axis might be caused by what they call “Planet Nine”: a hitherto unseen and entirely hypothetical celestial body!

Here's from an article at Phys.org musing about this still unexplained riddle: 

“_All of the planets orbit in a flat plane with respect to the sun, roughly within a couple degrees of each other. That plane, however, rotates at a **6-degree** tilt with respect to the sun — giving the appearance that the sun itself is cocked off at an angle. Until now, no one had found a compelling explanation to produce such an effect. **‘It's such a deep-rooted mystery and so difficult to explain that people just don’t talk about it,’** says Brown, the Richard and Barbara Rosenberg Professor of Planetary Astronomy.”_

- ["Curious tilt of the Sun traced to undiscovered planet" - by the California Institute of Technology (2016)](https://phys.org/news/2016-10-curious-tilt-sun-undiscovered-planet.html#jCp) 

And here’s from a 2016 article published at Astronomy.com : 

> _“The Sun’s rotation was measured for the first time in 1850 and something that was recognized right away was that its spin axis, its north pole, is tilted with respect to the rest of the planets by **6 degrees**. So even though **6 degrees** isn’t much, it is a big number compared to the mutual planet-planet misalignments. So the Sun is basically an outlier within the solar system. This is a long-standing issue and one that is recognized but people don’t really talk much about it. Everything in the solar system rotates roughly on the same plane **except for the most massive object, the Sun — which is kind of a big deal**.”_

Now, remember: in Chapter 6, we saw that the rotational axes of _both Mars and our own Moon_ are also inclined by about 7° degrees! One has to wonder just how the Copernican / heliocentric advocates would 'justify' this most remarkable state of affairs!  

As it turns out, the 6° (or 7°) tilt of the Sun’s rotational axis with respect to our ecliptic plane was known _long before 1850_; it was discovered by Christoph Scheiner back in the 1600’s during his extensive 20-year-long sunspot observations. His work was richly illustrated and published in his monumental treatise _Rosa Ursina_ (1630). In fact, the “sunspot-issue” triggered a bitter and infamous 30-year-long feud between Galileo and Christoph Scheiner (who, incidentally, was a staunch supporter of the Tychonic model). To be sure, the observed inclination of the Sun was no trivial matter: it was - and still is - a crucial issue within the endless heliocentrism-vs-geocentrism debate. 

> “Scheiner, in his massive 1630 treatise on sunspots entitled ‘Rosa Ursina’, accepted the view of sunspots as markings on the solar surface and used his accurate observations, to infer the fact that **the Sun’s rotation axis is inclined with respect to the ecliptic plane**.”

In the below illustration by Cristoph Scheiner, I have highlighted in red the 6° inclinations of his observed sunspot transits in January and July.

In September, the Sun's North pole tilts **towards** us; in March the Sun's North pole tilts **away** from us - as described in this paper by Bruce McClure:

> _“The Sun’s axis tilts almost 7.5 degrees out of perpendicular to Earth’s orbital plane. (The orbital plane of Earth is commonly called the ecliptic.) Therefore, as we orbit the Sun, there’s one day out of the year when the Sun’s North Pole tips most toward Earth. This happens at the end of the first week in September. Six months later, at the end of the first week in March, it’s the Sun’s South Pole that tilts maximumly towards Earth. There are also two days during the year when the Sun’s North and South Poles, as viewed from Earth, don’t tip toward or away from Earth. This happens at the end of the first week in in June, and six months later, at the end of the first week of December.”_

In the TYCHOS model, this 6° (or 7°) tilt of the Sun can be illustrated as follows:

In this other drawing, Scheiner showed how two sunspots were observed to be moving around the solar sphere in the month of March:
