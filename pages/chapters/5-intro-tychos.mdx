Chapter 5 — Introducing the TYCHOS model
========================================

The Sun and Mars are the main players of a what I have called our 'geoaxial' binary system. At or near its barycenter, we find Earth and our Moon, while the Sun (escorted by its two moons, Mercury and Venus) and Mars (escorted by its two moons, Phobos and Deimos) perform their binary dance around our planet. It is Earth’s physical motion around its “PVP” orbit (see blue circle) that causes our North stars to change over time – a very slow process commonly-known as the “precession of the equinoxes”.

The Sun revolves once a year around Earth, traveling at 107,226 km/h (the orbital speed attributed to Earth in the Copernican model). Every circa 2.13 years, its binary companion (Mars) reconjuncts with the Sun at either side of Earth (in so-called 'opposition'). In the TYCHOS, Earth is inclined at about 23° in relation to its orbital plane – yet (unlike current theory) its Northern hemisphere remains tilted at all times ‘outwards’, i.e. towards the external circuit of the Sun.

There is no need for Earth “wobbling around its polar axis” (a.k.a. "Earth's 3d motion") as of Copernican theory; nor does our tranquil planet hurtle around space at hypersonic speeds. Earth only rotates around its axis once every 24 hours while it slowly gets tugged around at 1.6 km/h (about 1 mph) by our entire solar system which, almost imperceptibly, precesses 'clockwise'. In the process, Earth thus completes one revolution around its “PVP orbit” every 25344 years (a period also known as “The Great Year”). One may consider the “PVP” orbit (_“Polaris-Vega-Polaris”_) as the'missing piece of the puzzle' of Tycho Brahe's ingenious and _near_-flawless geoheliocentric system. My proposed "PVP" orbit - and Earth's snail-paced motion around it - will of course be thoroughly expounded and illustrated further on, as they constitute the core postulations upon which the TYCHOS model is founded.

Oddly enough, Tycho Brahe apparently believed to his last day that Earth was totally stationary, did not rotate around its axis and that the stars all revolved around it in unison. One can only wonder how Tycho reconciled this belief with, for instance, the slow alternation of our polar stars through the ages. Eventually however (in 1622), Tycho’s trusty assistant Longomontanus (in his _Astronomia Danica_, regarded as “Tycho’s testament”) allowed for Earth’s daily rotation around its axis in what became known as the “semi-Tychonic” system. The observational accuracy of Longomontanus’ refined system has, to this day, never been surpassed:

> Longomontanus, Tycho’s sole disciple, assumed the responsibility and fulfilled both tasks in his voluminous ‘Astronomia Danica’ (1622). Regarded as the testament of Tycho, the work was eagerly received in seventeenth-century astronomical literature. But unlike Tycho’s, his geoheliocentric model gave the Earth a daily rotation as in the models of Ursus and Roslin, and which is sometimes called the ‘semi-Tychonic’ system. \[…\] Some historians of science claim Kepler’s 1627 ‘Rudolphine Tables’ based on Tycho Brahe’s observations were more accurate than any previous tables. But nobody has ever demonstrated they were more accurate than Longomontanus’s 1622 ‘Danish Astronomy’ tables, also based upon Tycho’s observations.

In short, the TYCHOS is nothing but a natural evolution of the semi-Tychonic system, and is largely consistent with the unequaled observational accuracy of the same; it provides a long overdue supportive addition to the extraordinary (yet abandoned!) work of Tycho Brahe and Longomontanus. Alas, their work was annihilated by the emergence of the Copernican heliocentric theory, which for unfathomable reasons prevailed – in spite of its numerous problems and aberrations. As we shall see, these problems stem from the distinctly unphysical nature of its proposed heliocentric geometry. It is a poorly-known fact that the Copernican theory was by no means immediately embraced as a self-evident truth. It was strongly (and justly) rejected for several decades by the wider scientific community due the many leaps of logic that its core premises demanded. One of the most formidable mental efforts required in order to accept the Copernican theory was, of course, the unthinkable dimensions and distances that the stars would have in relation to our system.

> Most scientists refused to accept \[Copernicus’s\] theory for many decades — even after Galileo made his epochal observations with his telescope. Their objections were not only theological. Observational evidence supported a competing cosmology,the “geo-heliocentrism” of Tycho Brahe. The most devastating argument against the Copernican universe was the star size problem. Rather than give up their theory in the face of seemingly incontrovertible physical evidence, Copernicans were forced to appeal to divine omnipotence.
