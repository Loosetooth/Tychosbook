Chapter 13 — Our system's 'central driveshaft': the Moon
================================================

The very fact that our lunar satellite – the Moon – appears to be some sort of “central driveshaft” of our entire system should, all by itself, undo the Copernican theory. In the heliocentric model it simply makes no conceivable sense that our Moon would have such a central role in our Solar System. Instead, if we envision our Moon as a body revolving around Earth at the center of our Sun-Mars binary system, then the central role of our Moon becomes evident.

In the TYCHOS, our Moon turns out to have the most revealing average synodic period of **29.22 days.**

I will henceforth call this 29.22-day period the Moon’s **TMSP**(True Mean Synodic Period). 

This figure provides us with the spectacular indication that our Moon plays a central role in our Sun-Mars binary system. This stands in stark contrast to the Copernican notion that the Moon is just some 'random' peripheral appendage circling around Earth. If that were the case, why would all of our system’s celestial bodies in the Copernican scenario exhibit exact multiples of Moon’s synodic period? Here are the facts:

The Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars exhibit an orbital resonance pattern of:  

### 1 : 4 : 20 : 25 

1 TMSP   : Average orbital period of our Moon: 29.22 days (29.22 X **1**) 

4 TMSP's : Average orbital period of Mercury: 116.88 days (29.22 X **4**) 

20 TMSP's: Average orbital period of Venus: 584.4 days (29.22 X **20**) 

25 TMSP's: Average orbital period of Mars: 730.5 days (29.22 X **25**)

The average orbital period of the Sun is 365.25 days (29.22 X **12.5**) — 1 solar year

Note that: 1 + 4 + 20 + 25 = 50

Divide 50 by 4 (the number of ratios) to achieve what we may call the “average resonance of our binary system" 
and you arrive at **12.5** – the number of moon orbits that equals 1 solar year.

Indeed, this lunar orbital resonance rule also applies to all of our so-called “outer” planets:

150 TMSP's : Average orbital period of Jupiter: 4383 days (29.22 X **150**) – or 12 solar years

375 TMSP's: Average orbital period of Saturn: 10,957.5days (29.22 X **375**) – or 30 solar years

1050 TMSP's: Average orbital period of Uranus: 30,681 days (29.22 X **1050**) – or 84 solar years

2062.5 TMSP's : Average orbital period of Neptune: 60,266.25 days (29.22 X **2062.5**) – or 165 solar years

3100 TMSP's : Average orbital period of Pluto: 90,582 days (29.22 X **3100**) – or 248 solar years

As we shall see, the only reason why this perfect clockwork (featuring all of our system’s celestial bodies revolving at exact multiples of the Moon’s true mean orbital period) has gone unnoticed by astronomers throughout the ages is, essentially, due to Earth’s previously unimagined “snail-paced” motion around its own orbit. Of course, unless one is aware of this motion, all earthly determinations of the orbital periods of our system’s celestial bodies will be ever-so-slightly in error. However, as it logically puts all the pieces together, the TYCHOS model gently unveils our universe’s breathtaking cosmic harmony.

In other words, the periods of all of the bodies in our Solar System are 'round' multiples of the Moon's TMSP of 29.22 days!

Our Moon is ostensibly at the center of our system in the capacity of some 'central driveshaft' for its cosmic companions.

I can hear an objection like, _“Hold it! Why 29.22 days? Isn’t the known synodic period of the moon 29.53 days?”_

Yes, that is indeed what an earthly observer may hastily conclude. Yet, that value will depend on the particular time-window chosen to compute the Moon’s _average / long-term_ synodic period. Therefore, only by spending centuries of careful observations will a correct average value of the Moon’s synodic period be obtained. That is just what the meticulous Aztecs appear to have done, as their famed Toltec Sunstone suggests.

> “To summarize, then, the Toltec Sunstone is an image of the motion of Venus, consisting of two hundred sixty, 8-year, periods, divided up into forty 52 year periods, as encoded in the ring of 40 quincunxes surrounding the ring of 20-day names. Each 8-year period of 2922 days is counted by a rotation of the 20 day-sign ring, where each day-sign actually represents one month of 29.22 days. Therefore, one complete revolution of the day-sign ring counts 20 x 29.22 days, or the average Venus year of 584.4 days. Five of these revolutions, each uniquely named in the center quincunx, counts 100 x 29.22 = 2922 days, or five Venus years of 584.4 days each, which is equivalent to eight years of 365.25 days each. By assigning the 20 day-sign symbols to a lunar month of 29.22 days, each month of the Venus year has a unique name, just as the twelve months of our Earth year has, making it easy for the public to mark the months, or ‘moons,’ as they went by.”

— p.6, [_The Aztec Calendar Stone is not Aztec and it is not a Calendar_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/115A_Aztec-Calendar-Stone-Paper.pdf) by Douglas L. Bundy (November 13, 2012)

For instance, if you choose a time-window of 65 years (+/- 2 days) - a little-known interval at both ends of which the Moon will realign with the Sun - you would conclude that the Moon’s average synodic period is “29.53 days”, because 65 X 365.25 days (+ 2 days) ≈ 23743 days.

If we divide 23743 days by 67 (the number of possible integer Lunar years in 65 solar years), we obtain 354.373 days.

Therefore, one average “Long ESI” (Empiric Synodic Interval) of the Moon will compute to:

354.373 days / 12 ≈ **29.53 days**

Whereas if you choose a time window of 19 years (a well-known time interval, the Metonic cycle, at both ends of which the Moon will realign with the Sun), you would conclude that moon’s average period is 28.91 days.

19 X 365.25 days = 6939.75 days

If we divide 6939.75 days by 20 (the number of possible/ integer Lunar years in 19 solar years) we obtain 346.98 days.  
Therefore, one average “short ESI” (Empiric Synodic Interval) of the Moon will compute to :

346.98 days / 12 = **28.915 days**

But the smart Aztecs probably knew better to average the Long and Short ESIs in order to obtain the more accurate (over longer time periods) True Mean Synodic Period:

(29.53 + 28.915 = 58.445) / 2 ≈ **29.22 days (our TMSP)**

The Moon also has a little-known 8-year cycle in which it very nearly realigns with the Sun every 2922 (+/-1.5 days) days.

This number can be obtained from: 100 revolutions X 29.22 = 2922 days = 8 solar years

Notably, the Moon’s 8-year cycle mirrors Venus’ 8-year cycle of 2922 days (5 Venus synodic periods of 584.4 days).


Thus, our TMSP of 29.22 days can be considered as the "Master Period" of our entire Solar System. The higher and lower observed values of those periods (29.53 days and 28.91 days) are just long-term fluctuations caused by the joint 1-mph-motion of Earth-Moon system as it proceeds along the PVP orbit. Since the Earth-Moon system revolves in the opposite direction of the Sun, their respective revolutions will be opposed or co-directional, depending on the time of year. The “acceleration/deceleration” illusion of the Moon - and its (only apparent) variable synodic periods - are thus created.

### The wondrous “synchronicities” of the Sun/Earth/Moon trio

A string of remarkable 'synchronicities' emerge when comparing the respective rotations and revolutions of Earth, the Sun and the Moon. They are remarkable in the sense that, if viewed through the Copernican paradigm, it becomes extremely difficult to fathom why those multiple and apparently coincidental synchronicities would exist. After all, if Earth (along with our Moon) is just one of several planets circling the Sun, it would seem to be a quite quaint circumstance that these three separate celestial bodies would have such 'commensurate' or 'resonant' gyrational periods. 

Firstly, one has to wonder why the Sun rotates around its axis in just about _the same amount of time_(≈27.3 days) that our Moon revolves around its orbit.

> “The Carrington rotation number identifies the solar rotation as a mean period of 27.28 days, each new rotation beginning when 0° of solar longitude crosses the central meridian of the Sun as seen from Earth.”

**Figure 1: The Sun and Moon's 27.3-days synchronicity - as viewed in the TYCHOS model:**

![][(http://www.septclues.com/TYCHOS/SunMoonSYNCH_01.jpg)

Note that, as far as I can tell, this remarkable synchronicity between the Sun's rotation and the Moon's sidereal revolution has never been pointed out nor debated in astronomy literature. In any case, I have personally failed to find any studies broaching this particular 'coincidence'. Let me now illustrate how this would look like - under the Copernican model's configuration of our Solar System:

**Figure 2: The Sun and Moon’s 27.3-day synchronicity, as viewed in the Copernican model.**

![](http://www.septclues.com/TYCHOS/SunMoonSYNCH_Copernican_01.jpg)

To wit, if our Moon were just one among hundreds of moons (Jupiter’s moons, Saturn’s moons, etc.) circling the Sun, why would only **one** of these lunar satellites (our own Moon) have such an “intimate relationship” with the Sun? Conversely, if our Moon were instead central to the Sun’s orbit, as posited by the Tychos model (Figure 1), you may agree that this fact would suddenly appear to make far more 'intuitive sense' - and not only philosophically speaking.

Let us now compare the respective rotational speeds of the Sun, Earth and the Moon.

-Rotational speed of Sun: 6675 km/h
-Rotational speed of Earth: 1670 km/h
-Rotational speed of Moon: 16.68 km/h

We see that:
-The Sun’s rotational speed is near-exactly 4 times the Earth’s rotational speed (6675/1670 ≈ 4)
-The Sun’s rotational speed is near-exactly 400 times our Moon’s rotational speed (6675/16.68 ≈ 400)
-Earth’s rotational speed is near-exactly 100 times our Moon’s rotational speed (1670/16.68 ≈100) 

Moreover,

-In the TYCHOS, the Moon’s rotational speed is approximately 10 times the orbital speed of Earth (16.68/1.601669 ≈10).

One truly has to wonder: Why would our Earth and Moon exhibit such multiple 'resonances and synchronicities' with the Sun (in terms of both rotational and orbital speeds) if our planet were just one of several bodies circling (in the "3d lane") around the Sun - as proposed by the Copernican heliocentric model?    

On the other hand, if our Earth and Moon are circling in the middle of the Sun’s orbit (as proposed by the TYCHOS model), all of this becomes a decidedly less mysterious affair: our Earth and Moon revolve _within_ the Sun's orbit - and thus enjoy a special and 'privileged' place in our Solar System (i.e. its 'barycenter'). I trust that this train of thought & logic makes sound sense - and will gradually become apparent to even the most skeptical readers of this book. 


### The Copernican model’s “lunatic” sidereal period

For this next argumentation (dismantling the Copernican theory), please keep in mind that if the Earth-Moon system truly traveled around the Sun at 107,226 km/h it would move by about 70 Million kilometers every 27.3 days. Yet, in observation, our Moon lines up with the very same star each and every 27.3-day-period.

As we take a good look at the Moon’s sidereal period (of 27.3 days) through the lens of the Copernican model (which has Earth and the Moon circling the Sun around a 300 Mkm-wide orbit) we see that, once again, it miserably fails the reality test.

Let us compare its premise to an imaginary 'real world' situation that we can easily relate to:

Imagine a prisoner held on a ship which perpetually travels around a huge, circular route. It takes 365 calendar days for the ship to complete this circle (the poor prisoner can sense that the ship is circling at a certain speed). His only equipment is a magnetic compass. One night, our man sees through his porthole a distant lighthouse and estimates its location as being due North of the middle of this ship’s circular path. He really wants to figure out how long it takes for the ship to complete its circular journey. So he raises his forefinger in front of his nose and patiently starts counting the days needed for the lighthouse to align again with his forefinger. 

The question is:

_**Should we expect our sailor to see that lighthouse regularly lining up with his finger every 27.322 days?**_

Of course not. Yet, this is exactly what is implied by the Copernican model! My below diagram depicts how our Moon is _meant_ (in the Copernican model) to align with a given star every 27.322 days - in spite of Earth's (supposed) orbital motion around the Sun: 

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/106_MoonSiderealPeriodABSURDITY_01.jpg)

To further illustrate this major Copernican aberration of perspective, here is how the SCOPE Planetarium depicts the solar eclipse of March 20, 2015 (which I personally viewed from Rome) compared to a successive position of Earth & Moon (27.3 days later, on 16 April, 2015. On both of these dates, the Moon conjuncted with the star Vernalis):

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/107_Moon_VERNALIS_03.jpg)

In fact, the entire Copernican theory relies on the misconception that “very distant objects (stars) will not be affected by parallax.”

Allow me now to state the obvious with regards to the fundamental optics & physics associated to the very concept of parallax:

**YES.** Very little parallax will occur between two very distant objects (such as two unequally distant stars).

**NO.** A relatively nearby object (such as the Moon) cannot possibly remain aligned with any distant star in line of sight whilst both the observer and the nearby object (in this case, our Moon) both drift laterally for several million kilometers. It does not matter how distant the star may be.

It is truly astonishing that the Copernican theory has survived, largely unchallenged, for as long as 400+ years.


### About Lunar and Solar Eclipses — the Saros and Exeligmos cycles

> “The saros is a period of approximately 223 synodic months (approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours), that can be used to predict eclipses of the Sun and Moon.”

— from Wikipedia on “[Saros astronomy](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Saros-astronomy.pdf)“

Note that the Saros cycle of 6585.3211 days is nearly equal to 16 Full Moon cycles of 411.78433 days:

6585.3211 / 16 ≈ 411.5825 days

Now, the 18-year Saros cycle is just part of a longer more complete Triple Saros cycle of 19,756 days. This is known as the “[Exeligmos](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Exeligmos.pdf)” (Wikipedia link).

> “The Mesopotamians, and in particular the Babylonians, were one of the first civilisations to keep records of their astronomical observations. Because of this, they were also the first to notice a remarkable pattern: that eclipses of a particular type are repeated every 18 years, and more closely repeated every 54 years. The 18 year period became known as the Saros, and the 54 year one as the Triple Saros or Exeligmos.”

— [_On the Saros_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/119A_On-the-Saros.htm) by Kevin Clarke (1999), InconstantMoon.com

As a 54-year Exeligmos is completed, our Moon returns to its 'start position', which means that a lunar or solar eclipse will recur in roughly the same geographic region as it did 54 years earlier. It is important to note that at the completion of one Exeligmos the eclipse will return to a place positioned 90 minutes earlier in our celestial sphere.

1440 minutes / 90 minutes = 16 (That is, the Moon will gain 1/16th of a full revolution of our celestial sphere).

When we consider Earth’s 1 mph motion, it gets really interesting. The distance covered by Earth-Moon system in the course of a 54-year Exeligmos cycle turns out to be very close to the **orbital diameter** of our Moon (ca. 763,000 km).

19756 days X 38.43 km = 759,223.08 km

This is just about 3800 km shorter than the Moon’s orbital diameter. However, one may reasonably assume that this discrepancy may be accounted for by the diameter of the Moon itself (3476 km). In short, it would seem intuitively logical that an Exeligmos cycle will be completed _when Earth and the Moon have together covered a distance almost equal to the Moon’s orbital diameter:_

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/108_MoonOrbit_EXELIGMOS_01.jpg)


The Triple Saros cycle or “Exeligmos” comprises ca. 19,756 days, into which one can find nearly 48 Full Moon cycle lengths.

19,756 / 411.78433 days (a Full Moon cycle) ≈ **48**

Please read the Wikipedia entry on “[Full moon cycle](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Full_moon_cycle.pdf)”.

### The Moon’s Perigee Precession agrees with the TYCHOS Great Year

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/109_MoonPerigeePrecession_01.jpg)

The above graphic depicts the current astronomical understanding of the Moon’s perigee precession (_a.k.a._ the Moon’s “apsidal precession”). It is observed that our Moon’s perigee precesses by 0.1114° per day:

> “Note that the lunar perigee precesses in the direction of the moon’s orbital motion at the rate of n−n˜ = 0.1114 ◦ per day, or 360◦ in 8.85 years.”

— [_A Modern Almagest: An Updated Version of Ptolemy’s Model of the Solar System_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/121A_Almagest.pdf) by Richard Fitzpatrick (2010)

So, if our Moon’s perigee precesses by 0.1114° daily, it will complete one 360° revolution in 8.8476327 years.

360° / 0.1114° ≈ 3231.5978 (days) or **8.8476327 years**

In total, the Moon’s perigee precesses annually by

0.1114° X 365.25 = 40.68885° (or **146,479.86** arcseconds)

As we compare this empirically-observed annual precession value of Moon’s perigee with our ACP of 51.136”, we see that the Moon’s perigee precesses 2864.495 X faster than the Sun.

146,479.86" / 51.136" ≈ 2864.495

Remember that our ACP of 51.136" adds up to a full 360° precession in 25344 years.

3231.5978 days / 29.22 days(the TMSP) ≈ 110.595408

There are 110.5954 TMSPs in 8.847632 years.

110.5954 X 2864.495 ≈ 316,800

Ergo the TMSPs completed in one Tychos Great Year of 25344 solar years are in perfect accord with my proposed Sun-Moon orbital resonance of 1 : 12.5.

12.5 X 25344 = 316,800

In conclusion, the Moon’s empirically-observed apsidal precession is in full agreement with the TYCHOS model.

****************************************************************************************************************

In this chapter I have highlighted the most conspicuous aspect concerning our lunar satellite - i.e. its role as the 'central driveshaft' of our Solar System. Yet, many more aspects pertaining to the Moon's observed motions need to be addressed and elucidated. As any earnest astronomer or cosmologist will readily admit, the Moon's puzzling behavior has never been fully resolved to this day - in spite of being the closest (and visually largest) globe orbiting planet Earth. The next chapter will therefore take a closer look at the subtler aspects of our Moon's observed motions which, notoriously, caused Sir Isaac Newton's many a headache! As we shall see, the TYCHOS model can provide sound and logical answers to the remaining 'lunar mysteries' haunting the world's scientific community.
