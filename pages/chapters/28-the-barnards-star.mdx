Chapter 28: The Barnard's star confirms the TYCHOS
===========================================

Barnard's star is the fastest-moving star in our skies : as viewed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere, it is observed to briskly "ascend" in our skies, by as much as 10.36" (arcseconds) every year. It is also the next-closest star to Earth (after the Alpha Centauri binary system). As recently as November 2018, it was discovered that Barnard's star also has a companion and is therefore probably also a binary star system (see Chapter 2). It can be found 'due South' at midnight of the summer solstice (at 17h47m of Right Ascension) and fairly close to our equatorial ecliptic (at 04°41' of Declination). We shall now see how the observed motion of Barnard's star provides further support to the TYCHOS model's tenets and, in particular, to the trochoidal curve - "A Man's Yearly Path" - around which any earthly observer will gyrate annually (see Chaper 21).

An experienced amateur astronomer, [Dennis Di Cicco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_di_Cicco) is known for having most accurately monitored and photographed this rapidly-moving star for at least 16 months (between 1994 and 1996) and to have plotted this diagram of his extended observations:

Di Cicco's diagram shows how Barnard's star is observed to rise in our skies, "South-to-North" (and at a slight East-West angle). As you can see, this path exhibits an asymmetric curve (oscillating "from left-to-right") which I have highlighted in pink and blue. This curve has a distinct 4-month / 8-month frequency. 

The question is: what could possibly cause this 4-month / 8-month oscillation? Are we asked to believe that Barnard's star is somehow "zig-zagging" in space, all by itself, as it rises up in our skies - _at an exact 4-month / 8-month rate?_ Can the Copernican model explain this observed behavior of Barnard's star? Well, no.

Does the TYCHOS have any rational explanation for these bizarre, asymmetric East-West oscillating motions of Barnard's star? Well, yes.

Now, you may recall that 3:1 ratio of a "Man's Yearly Path" (as expounded in Chapter 21). In this case, however, we will be looking at a 2:1 ratio (i.e. 8 months versus 4 months). This, because the Barnard's star does not circle around us (unlike the Sun or the Moon). Therefore, an earthly observer (revolving around his annual trochoidal path) who will, for a full year, patiently monitor a star located close to our equatorial ecliptic (such as Barnard's star) will see it oscillating "East / West" at a 2:1 ratio (or at an 8-month / 4-month ratio). I do realize that this can be a rather tricky matter to conceive and visualize ('spatially-speaking') - but hopefully my below diagram will clarify the peculiar perspectives at play:

**WHY BARNARD'S STAR "WOBBLES SIDEWAYS" AS OBSERVED**

 In reality, of course, the Barnard's star does not truly / physically zigzag in such manner as it travels across space. Its sideways oscillation is simply a consequence of the earthly observer's annual, trochoidal path. Our earthly frame of reference (vis-à-vis the stars) is constantly fluctuating back and forth along this "looping" path - and this goes to explain a great many _"irregularities, inequalities and aberrations"_ that astronomers, cosmologists and astrophysicists have been endlessly debating for the last few centuries. You may for instance recall (from Chapter 17) that it was once thought that Jupiter would inevitably end up crashing into the Sun, while Saturn would be driven away into the depths of space! Thankfully, such apocalyptic 'End-of-Days predictions' (prognosticated in the early 20th century by our world's foremost scientists) were entirely spurious and - as the TYCHOS demonstrates - only due to their flawed, heliocentric interpretation of our Solar System. 
 
On a philosophical note, it is rather amusing to see how intellectual human minds often seem to contemplate some sort of self-destructive tendencies of Mother Nature - and of the Universe as a whole. This paranoid attitude is not, in my humble opinion, conducive to a sane and serene advancement of human knowledge. With the TYCHOS model in mind, we may now stop conjecturing about assorted "chaos theories" of our cosmos - and start enjoying its graceful harmony and stability.
 
There really isn't much more to say about the observed motions of Barnard's star - but perhaps this final graphic on the subject will help you envision just how and why Dennis Di Cicco (who deserves a giant hat tip) recorded these peculiar motions of our next-to-nearmost star :

Next, we shall take an amorous look at the charming Eros asteroid which was the very first NEA (Near-Earth Asteroid) to be discovered.
