Chapter 18 - Uranus, Neptune & Pluto prove the PVP orbit
=====================================================

Uranus, Neptune and Pluto can all be shown to appear offset due to Earth’s 1.6km/h motion around its PVP orbit. All three of them are currently believed to have orbital periods curiously just a whisker short of an integer number of solar years (much like we just saw with Jupiter and Saturn).

#### Uranus

“Orbital period: 30,589 days” — about 83.74 years, or a trifle less than **84** years

#### Neptune

“Orbital Period: 60,182 days.” — about 164.77 years, or a trifle less than **165** years

#### Pluto

“Orbital Period: 90,560 days.” — about 247.94 years, or a trifle less than **248** years

In reality, the orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are all perfectly synchronized (at integer multiples) with the Moon's TMSP of 29.22 days. In the TYCHOS, their true orbital periods are, respectively, 84, 165 & 248 solar years - exactly.

The only reason why they will appear to be slightly “offset” after completing one of their orbits in relation to the stars, is due to the parallax effect for earthly observers. This will presently be demonstrated by my next three graphics which feature screenshots (at intervals of 84, 165 and 248 years) taken from the NEAVE online planetarium.

It is essential to fully understand what is meant by “the exact same place”. Yes, this means that these planets return to the same location in space within the said time intervals. As viewed from Earth, however, they will appear to have precessed by a small amount in relation to the star background. These small amounts can all be shown to be due to Earth slowly revolving 'clockwise' (i.e in the opposite direction of those three distant planets). 

### Uranus — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period of Uranus: exactly 84 Solar Years, or 30,681 days – or **exactly** 1050 X 29.22 days(our Moon's TMSP).

In 84 years, Earth moves by 14035.847 km X 84 ≈ 1,179,011km (i.e. 0.3314% of the PVP orbit circumference of 355,724,597 km). Now, 0.3314% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min. = 4.77216 min. of RA.

In fact, the NEAVE planetarium shows us a close match:

Between Oct 15, 2016 and Oct 15, 2100 (84 years), Uranus returns to the same celestial longitude (RA) + circa 4.4 min. of RA.

We may thus reasonably conclude that this apparent displacement of Uranus is 

### Neptune — in the TYCHOS:

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/115_NEPTUNE_parallax_165years_01.jpg)

Orbital period: exactly 165 Solar Years, or 60,266.25 days – or **exactly** 2062.5 x 29.22 days (our Moon's TMSP).

In 165 years, Earth moves by 14035.847 km X 165 ≈ 2,315,915 km (0.651% of the PVP orbit circumference of 355,724,597 km). Now, 0.651% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min. ≈ 9.375 min. of RA — and in fact, the NEAVE planetarium shows us a close match.

Between Sept 5, 2017 and Sept 5, 2182 (165 years) Neptune returns to the same celestial longitude (RA) + circa 10 min. of RA!

Note that the Earth-Neptune parallax (9.375 min.) is ca. 1.965 X larger than the Earth-Uranus parallax (4.77216 min.).

This reflects the fact that Neptune’s revolution period of 165 years is ca. 1.965 X longer than Uranus’s revolution period of 84 years.

### Pluto — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period: exactly 248 Solar Years, or 90,582 days – or **exactly** 3100 X 29.22 days(our Moon's TMSP).

In 248 years, Earth moves by 14035.847 km X 248 ≈ 3,480,890 km (0.978535% of the PVP orbit circumference of 355,724,597 km). Now, 0.978535% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min. ≈ 14 min. of RA — again, the NEAVE planetarium gives us another (near) match:

Between Oct 28, 1941 and Oct 28, 2189 (248 years), Pluto returns to the same celestial longitude (RA) + circa 12 min. of RA.\*

Note that the (expected) Earth-Pluto parallax (14 min.) is ca. 1.5 X larger than the Earth-Neptune parallax (9.3744 min.).

This reflects the fact that Pluto’s revolution period of 248 years is ca. 1.5 X longer than Neptune’s revolution period of 165 years.

\* NOTE: The reason why Pluto, with its almost 250-year-long period, is observed to be advancing by only 12 min (that is, two minutes less than the expected 14 min) should become apparent in a later chapter - which will describe how the peculiar Gregorian calendar-count sloppily attempts to 'contain' the secular precession of our solar system.

In conclusion, the true values of the orbital periods of these planets are in actuality, integer multiples of the TMSP (our Moon's True Mean Synodic Period). All of their apparent precessional drifts relatively to the background stars can be shown to be parallax effects directly caused by Earth’s 1-mph motion around its PVP orbit.
