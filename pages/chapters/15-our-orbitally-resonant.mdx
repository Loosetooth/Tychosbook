Chapter 15 — Our orbitally-resonant system “regulated” by our Moon
==================================================================

In the TYCHOS model, all the celestial bodies in our system — including the Sun and its moons — are moving synchronously together, which I attribute to a yet-unexplained orbital resonance. This peculiar and wonderful discovery is even more fascinating when it is noted that the common unit is our Moon’s true orbital period of 29.22 days.

The very fact that our little satellite – the Moon – appears to be some sort of “central driveshaft” of our entire system should, all by itself, undo the Copernican theory. It makes no conceivable sense that our Moon – which in the heliocentric model spins around Earth on its own course corrected by nothing but gravity, while the two of them supposedly revolve around their own separate orbital slots – would have such a central role in our system. Instead, if we envision our Moon as a body revolving around Earth at the center of our Sun-Mars binary system’s barycenter, then the central role of our Moon becomes a decidedly less mysterious affair.

In order to understand this spectacular discovery, please take note of these significant numbers. Our Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars exhibit an orbital resonance pattern of:  

### 1 : 4 : 20 : 25

1 :

Average orbital period of Moon: **29.22 days** (29.22 X **1**) – or 0.08 solar years

4 :

Average orbital period of Mercury: 116.88 days (29.22 X **4**) — or 0.32 solar years

20 :

Average orbital period of Venus: 584.4 days (29.22 X **20**) – or 1.6 solar years

25 :

Average orbital period of Mars: 730.5 days (29.22 X **25**) – or 2 solar years

This was not noticed or discovered until now, when the TYCHOS system logically “revealed” the synchronicity by sheer observation and reanalysis of the available astronomical data that I have laid out for you in this text.

As I began to account for these remarkably synchronous orbital periods, more amazing coincidences jumped out at me as if waiting to be marveled at.

For example, the average orbital period of the Sun is 365.25 days (29.22 X **12.5**) — 1 solar year

Note that: 1 + 4 + 20 + 25 = 50

Divide 50 by 4 (the number of ratios) to achieve what we may call the “average resonance” of our system and you arrive at **12.5** – the number of moon orbits that equals a solar year.

Indeed, this lunar orbital resonance rule also applies to all of our “outer” planets:

150 :

Average orbital period of Jupiter: 4383 days (29.22 X **150**) – or 12 solar years

375 :

Average orbital period of Saturn: 10,957.5days (29.22 X **375**) – or 30 solar years

1050 :

Average orbital period of Uranus: 30,681 days (29.22 X **1050**) – or 84 solar years

2062.5 :

Average orbital period of Neptune: 60,266.25 days (29.22 X **2062.5**) – or 165 solar years

3100 :

Average orbital period of Pluto: 90,582 days (29.22 X **3100**) – or 248 solar years

As we shall see, the only reason why this perfect clockwork (featuring all of our system’s celestial bodies revolving at exact multiples of the Moon’s true mean orbital period) has gone unnoticed by astronomers throughout the ages is, essentially, due to Earth’s previously unimagined “snail-paced” motion around its own orbit. Of course, unless one is aware of this motion, all earthly determinations of the orbital periods of our system’s celestial bodies will be ever-so-slightly in error. However, as it logically puts all the pieces together, the TYCHOS model gently unveils our universe’s breathtaking cosmic harmony.
