Chapter 27 - The most MOMENTOUS incongruity
===========================================

Perhaps the greatest problem posed by the heliocentric model is that of the minuscule Angular Momentum that our Sun exhibits (only 0.3% of our entire Solar System's combined angular momentum!). That is, under the paradigm of current theory - which has the Sun completing just ONE of its orbits in 240 million years or so... This is a seemingly insuperable impasse that keeps haunting our world's cosmologists & astrophysicists. Yet, to this day, no one has ever put forth any resolution to what amounts to a glaring contradiction of Newton's fundamental law of conservation of momentum. In fact, this issue is of paramount importance to those studying the very formation of our universe.

This befuddling riddle is known in astronomy circles as the "Angular Momentum Problem". It is a widely recognized problem among cosmologists who study the so-called "formation theories" (i.e. the hypotheses of how our stars, planets, moons, etc were formed in the first place).

> _**"Angular momentum problem** : The fact that the Sun, which contains nearly all of the mass of the solar system, accounts for just 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. This is an aspect of the solar system that any acceptable formation theory must address."_

That's right, ladies & gents: any theory of our Solar System that doesn't address or/and fails to resolve the issue of the Sun's 0.3% AM is _not acceptable._ Therefore, any Newtonian advocates who may be inclined to falsify and disprove the TYCHOS model must firstly submit an explanation for this momentous incongruity presented by the almost universally-accepted heliocentric theory.  

Here are some scholarly descriptions of the thorny Angular Momentum Problem :

> _**Solar System -The Angular Momentum Problem**
"Perhaps the most important issue to be resolved in future versions of the solar nebula model is that of the distribution of angular momentum. The problem for the solar nebula theory is that it predicts that most of the mass and angular momentum should be in the Sun. In other words, the Sun should spin much more rapidly than it does. A mechanism is therefore required to transport angular momentum away from the central proto-sun and redistribute it in the outer planetary disk. One proposed transport mechanism invokes the presence of magnetic field in the nebula, while another mechanism proposed the existence of viscous stresses produced by turbulence in the nebular gas."_ [The Angular Momentum Problem - Science Jrank.org](https://science.jrank.org/pages/6266/Solar-System-angular-momentum-problem.html)

> _**The Angular Momentum Problem**
"A possible weak link in the condensation theory is sometimes known as the angular momentum problem. Although our Sun contains about 1000 times more mass than all the planets combined, it possesses a mere 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. Jupiter, for example, has a lot more angular momentum than does our Sun—in fact, about 60 percent of the solar system's angular momentum. All told, the four jovian planets account for well over 99 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. By comparison, the lighter (and closer) terrestrial planets have negligible angular momentum. The problem here is that all mathematical models predict that the Sun should have been spinning very rapidly during the earliest epochs of the solar system and should command most of the solar system's angular momentum, basically because it contains most of the mass. However, as we have just seen, the reverse is true. Indeed, if all the planets' orbital angular momentum were transferred to the Sun, **it would spin on its axis about 100 times as fast as it does at present**."_ [The Angular Momentum Problem - Astrotoday](https://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/AT315/HTML/AT31505.HTM)

> _**The Planet-X and Angular Momentum Problem**
"Many hypotheses have been formulated to justify the missing angular momentum, such as the loss of solar mass due to solar radiations, solar wind and solar magnetic ﬁeld. However, as we will see below, the ejection mass due to these phenomena can not compensate for the missing angular momentum, which remains an unsolved problem to this day, as are the anomalies detected in the TNOs orbits. (...)The Sun only accounts for about 0.6% of the total angular momentum of the solar system! This result is really unexpected since nebular model predicts that most of the mass and angular momentum should be in the Sun. The problem is known as «angular momentum problem». Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this problem, but there is still no convincing theory."_ [Planet-X and Angular Momentum Problem - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/32890375/The_Planet-X_and_Angular_Momentum_Problem)

As you can see, no one knows why the currently-computed angular momentum of our Sun (which is believed to contain 1000X the mass of all the planets combined) could possibly amount to less than 1% of the combined angular momentum of our entire solar system! This humongous riddle is, believe it or not, still up for grabs!

Moreover, it makes no sense (under current theory) that our Sun would rotate around its axis as slowly as it does - at 6670km/h (incidentally, near-exactly 4X Earth's rotational speed) whereas Jupiter, for instance, rotates at a brisk 43,000km/h. Besides, it is also believed that the Sun's rotational speed is gradually slowing down; tentative attempts have been made to explain this other puzzle, yet they all appear to belong to the realm of wild speculation. As one fantastic theory goes, the Sun's spin rate would be slowed down by none other than... its own photons!

So what can we - i.e. humankind - possibly do in order to resolve this momentous incongruity of the Newtonian principles? One truly cannot exaggerate the gravity of the situation (pun intended)! Are we poor souls destined to remain forever in ignorance of the workings of our cosmos? And is ALL of gravitational physics just a terrible mistake? Or, to put it bluntly:

**Do we have to "throw out Newton's baby - _AND_ the bath water"?**

Not necessarily.
