Chapter 11: Earth’s PVP orbit (Polaris-Vega-Polaris) 
=====================================================

We shall now proceed to see how the TYCHOS model accounts for the all-important “Precession of the Equinoxes” - or, as modern astronomers would call it, the "General Precession". Here's how this name change is explained at the Wikipedia entry for "Axial precession": 

> _"With improvements in the ability to calculate the gravitational force between planets during the first half of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as 1863, while the dominant component was named lunisolar precession. Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes."_

If, as demonstrated by several modern-day independent studies, Earth does NOT wobble around its polar axis, it follows that we need to explain how and why our Pole stars keep changing over time. We know that the (binary) star system Thuban, for instance, was our “North star” roughly 4600 years ago. In our current epoch, the (binary) triple star system Polaris is our “North star”. In about 11700 years from now - around the year 13720AD - the (binary) star system Vega will become our “North star”. This is generally agreed upon by most of our world's astronomers. 

Here is a classic / conventional illustration plotting the circular motion responsible for our “North Stars” to change over time. Please note that, if viewed from an imaginary spaceship hovering above our North Pole, this circular motion proceeds in a clockwise direction:

Now, if Earth doesn’t wobble around its polar axis (as currently believed), could it instead be _physically_ moving clockwise (as seen from our North stars) below the circular path which extends from Polaris to Vega, and back again to Polaris? Surely, this wouldn’t be too much of a fanciful proposition; after all, we now know that every single celestial body in our skies move around 'local' orbits of their own. In any event, to believe that Earth would be the ONE-AND-ONLY orbitless, non-rotating and immobile body in the entire universe is just silly - yet, this is what most 'biblical' geocentrists (and flat earthers) propose... 

Let us put this proposition to the test and see if we can find out at what speed the Earth would travel as it completes this 360° journey - around a circle which I have called **the PVP orbit** (Polaris-Vega-Polaris). To do so, we will first need to estimate its approximate diameter. My next set of graphics should hopefully illustrate in a comprehensible manner the methodology behind my appraisal of the PVP orbit's diameter.

### The PVP orbit — Earth’s path below our North Stars

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/072_PVP_ORBIT_final_01.jpg)

Perusing 'earthbound' digital simulators such as the Neave Planetarium, we can see that the Sun (as it moves around our 360° celestial sphere) covers a distance subtending 2h56min of RA (Right Ascension) in 44 days - or 1056 hours. 

In this other conceptual graphic, I show how the Sun would 'visually' employ ca. 44 days to cover the distance between Polaris and Vega **(_as viewed under an imaginary circumpolar orbit of the Sun_)**. I do realize that my conceptual graphics can be somewhat challenging to envisage - but they are the best I can do to help the reader 'visualize' the train of thoughts that led me to formulate the TYCHOS model's PVP orbit. 

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/PVPorbit_explanation_02.jpg)

We may therefore perform a simple calculation to estimate the diameter of our PVP orbit. Assuming the Sun travels at 107226 km/h, in 1056 hours the Sun would cover the distance of:

107226 km/h X 1056h = **113 230 656 km** (the diameter of our PVP orbit)

Hence, the circumference of Earth’s orbit will be:

113 230 656 km X π = **355 724 597 km**  (the circumference of our PVP orbit)

In this last diagram, I illustrate in further detail how all of this would be consistent with empirical observations:

- Polaris is currently observed to be at 89° of declination (i.e. almost exactly above our North Pole).
- Vega is currently observed to be at 39° of declination (i.e. about 50° 'away' from Polaris).
- In about 11700 years, Vega will become our North star (although only at 86° above our North pole - as officially predicted). 

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/PVP_ORBIT_longterm_03.jpg) 

In about 11700 years Earth's axis will then be tilted (as officially predicted) by 22.9° - as opposed to the current 23.4° - for a total axial rotation (in relation to our 180° Northern celestial hemisphere) of 46.3°. This 3.7° difference (between 50° and 46.3°) can be accounted for by Earth's 113.2 Mkm displacement along its PVP orbit. This, because in the TYCHOS (as we shall see later on) the Earth-Vega distance is estimated to be ≈37AU. The PVP orbit's diameter of 113.2 Mkm (or 0.757AU) amounts to ca. 2.05% of 37AU - and that aforementioned 3.7° difference amounts to ca. 2.05% of 180°.   

### ESTIMATING THE ORBITAL SPEED OF EARTH 

As will be extensively tested and cross-verified throughout this book, the duration of Earth's "Great Year" (as of the TYCHOS model) is **25344 solar years.** This is about 1.68% shorter than the current 'official' estimate of 25771 solar years - for motives that will be clarified in Chapter 12.

There are 8766 hours in 365.25 days. Therefore, 25344 years will add up to:

25344 X 8766 hours = **222 165 504 hours**

Now that we know how many hours that Earth will need to cover the distance of 355 724 597 km (the PVP orbit’s circumference), we may compute Earth’s orbital speed:

355 724 597 km / 222 165 504 hours = **1.601169** km/h or approximately **1 mph**! (1 mph = 1.609344 km)

### That’s right: _≈1.6 km/h - or ≈1mph!_ 
**This is Earth’s proposed orbital speed in the TYCHOS model.**

_“By Jove! Could our dear old Mother Earth be tranquilly strolling around at window-shopping pace?”_

My very first thoughts - soon after computing Earth’s languid speed around its PVP orbit - was the following: has life on Earth, perhaps, been facilitated by this sluggish, snail-paced motion of our planet? Could this exceptional tranquillity graced to Earth (for being “stuck” at the barycenter of the Sun-Mars binary system) be a key prerequisite for habitability (along with water, photosynthesis, etc) and biological life as we know it to blossom on _any_ given planet? Moreover, isn’t this serene situation enjoyed by our planet rather reminiscent of a ship gently circling around the calm zone in the eye of a tropical cyclone - while the spinning storm rages around it, moving in the opposite direction of the ship?

For now though, I shall leave my poetic & philosophical musings aside and proceed to put this posited orbital speed of Earth to the test - in methodical fashion. As we proceed one step at the time, we shall see that Earth’s 1-mph-motion around its PVP orbit effectively resolves a number of extant puzzles, quandaries and still unresolved enigmas of astronomy - as readily admitted by most earnest and free-thinking astronomers. 

We can now work with an empirically testable Sun-Earth velocity ratio. To be sure, that is not the same as stating (as current theory does) that _“the Sun hurtles around the galaxy at 800000 km/h along with our system’s planets – while Earth revolves around the Sun at 107226 km/h”,_ all of this in the absence of any observational indications in support of such formidable, hypersonic speeds. One may well say that these outlandish velocities upheld by Copernican theorists have been an offense to human intelligence all along, since this would mean our entire Solar System travels across space by more than 7 billion kilometers each year. Yet, the stars in our Milky Way (which supposedly all revolve 'in unison' around the centre of our galaxy) all exhibit microscopic proper motions in all sorts of random directions - their only common (_and much larger_) motion being that annual ≈50 arc-second eastward drift known as the "General Precession". In the TYCHOS model, of course, this common ≈50 arc-second eastward drift of the entire firmament is simply caused by Earth's motion around its PVP orbit.    

Those familiar with the infamous Michelson-Morley experiment, billed as _"the most failed scientific experiment of all time"_, may begin to sense that the TYCHOS model might yet vindicate the same; the experiment’s objective was to try and measure Earth’s translational velocity across space (or through the “aether”). Of course, the expected speed of Earth was something in the region of 107000 km/h, yet nothing of the sort was found. Here is what we may read in astronomy literature:

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/073_MichelsonVSLorentz_and_Fresnel_01.jpg)

Above — Extract from p.74, _[The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Philosophical Papers Volume 1 (Book 1)](https://books.google.it/books?id=RRniFBI8Gi4C&lpg=PA74&ots=2mHybhOICr&dq=%22quite%20small%20enough%20entirely%20to%20refute%20Fresnel%27s&hl=it&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=quite%20small%20enough%20entirely&f=false)_ by Imre Lakatos, Cambridge University Press (November 28, 1980)

As you can see, not only did Michelson conclude that Earth’s speed had to be quite small, but he even _“thought of the possibility that the solar system as a whole might have moved in the opposite direction to the Earth”_. In hindsight, both of those assertions would seem to be congruent with the TYCHOS model‘s proposed, snail-paced 1-mph motion of Earth, as it revolves in the opposite direction of our Solar System's 'family members'. In any event, the numerous successive interferometer experiments performed by other scientists all failed to detect speeds anywhere near the presumed orbital speed of Earth (107226 km/h - or ≈30 km/sec). The speeds detected  were, oddly enough, dismissed as "null" by the scientific community of the time. However, none of the many interferometer experiments yielded "null" results; they generally agreed with each other to some extent, and would actually seem to support Earth's 'snail-paced' orbital speed - as will be thoroughly expounded further on.   


## ESTIMATING THE "ACP" (ANNUAL CONSTANT OF PRECESSION)

If we consider that 25344 years represents a full 360° equinoctial precession, we should now be curious to find out how long it takes for Earth’s equinoctial axis to rotate (in relation to the stars) by just 1°. Let's see how this supposition would pan out as we apply it to the observed synodic periods of Mars, Venus, Mercury and the Moon:

25344 / 360 = 70.4 solar years

We see that **70.4** solar years (or 25713.6 days) equals precisely:

33 synodic periods of Mars (779.2 days X 33 = 25713.6 days)

44 synodic periods of Venus (584.4 days X 44 = 25713.6 days)

220 synodic periods of Mercury (116.88 days X 220 = 25713.6 days)

880 synodic periods of the Moon (29.22 days X 880 = 25713.6 days)

It is interesting to note that in Babylonian astronomy, the “Sar” cycle was an important period of 3600 years, which, when multiplied by 7.04 gets us the Great Year length of 25344 years - as proposed by the TYCHOS. Let us also note for now that 704 years (70.4 X 10) is equivalent to:

1/3rd of 2112 years

1/6th of 4224 years

1/36th of 25344 years

We may now tentatively compute Earth’s annual “equinoctial procession rate” as of the TYCHOS system. If Earth’s equinoxes process by 1° every 70.4 years, then every century (100 years) they process by:

100 / 70.4 = 1.42045° - or 5113.63" arcseconds

Hence, our annual “precession rate of Earth’s equinoxes” is:

5113.6363 / 100 = **51.136 arcseconds**

Note that 51.136 X 25344 = 1 296 000 arcseconds(i.e. 360°).

Henceforth I will refer to this all-important figure of 51.136 arcseconds as our **“ACP"** (Annual Constant of Precession).

Interestingly, back in the 16th century (when most astronomers estimated the annual precession at about 50" or less), Longomontanus and Tycho Brahe used a fixed rate of 51 arcsecs/year for their precession calculi: 

> _"Rather than using the Prutenic precession (variable rate) Longomontanus used Tycho’s precession (fixed rate of 51 arcsecs/year)."_

[Longomontanus on Mars: The Last Ptolemaic
Mathematical Astronomer Creates a Theory - by Richard Kremer](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/pdf/10.1484/M.PALS-EB.5.120186)

In the following chapters, we shall see how this 51.136” value can, in a number of ways, correctly account for the observed motions of our Solar System - as Earth slowly revolves around its 25344-year “PVP” orbit at the tranquil, 'snail-paced' speed of 1.6km/h (or 1mph).

### MARS'S CLOSEST PASSAGES TO EARTH - IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE PVP ORBIT!

As we saw in Chapter 5, Mars can transit as close as 0.373 Mkm from Earth (as it did in 2003). 
However, as shown in the below table, the AVERAGE figure of its closest passages is 0.379AU.

CLOSEST MARS OPPOSITIONS (1924 – 2050)

0.372838 (Aug 23, 1924)

0.387873 (July 27, 1939)

0.378090 (Sept 7, 1956)

0.375684 (Aug 12, 1971)

0.393141 (Sept 22, 1988)

0.372709 (Aug 27, 2003)

0.384955 (July 31, 2018)

0.380399 (Sept 11, 2035)

0.374041 (Aug 15, 2050)

TOTAL: 3.41973 

AVERAGE: 3.41973 / 9 ≈ 0.379 AU 
**or almost exactly PVP orbit’s radius of 0.37845AU (or 56.615328 Mkm)!**

I'd like to state for the record that I only realized this astounding fact long after I had tentatively estimated the diameter of the PVP orbit of 113.2 Mkm (i.e. 2 X 56.6 Mkm)! I trust you may imagine my delight when this was discovered - during one of my late night computing sessions. You may appreciate the utmost importance of this finding - as it would certainly support the proposed size of the PVP orbit's diameter. Unless, of course, you wish to chalk this up to some 'fortunate, accidental coincidence'!

This concludes my account of how Earth's PVP orbit was determined - and how, consequently, Earth's orbital speed of 1.6km/h was estimated.

Below are some preliminary data which you may wish to get familiar with - before continuing what should be a fascinating discovery journey.
