Chapter 11 — Venus — the Sun’s senior moon
==========================================

It has been observed that Venus invariably presents **the same face** (to us earthly observers) each time it transits closest to _**Earth**_, every 584.4 days or so. Note that Venus is, of all our surrounding celestial objects, the one that passes closest to Earth.

As it is, this apparent “tidal” locking of Venus with Earth is, still today, a complete mystery to modern astronomy. Of course, according to the Copernican model, Earth travels at its own speed around a larger orbit than Venus, which in turn travels somewhat faster around its smaller orbit, yet Venus always appears to show the same face to us every time it passes closest to Earth (when Venus is at so-called inferior conjunction with the Sun). Well, and once again, this would be another “extraordinary coincidence” as viewed under the Copernican model.

> “The periods of Venus’ rotation and of its orbit are synchronized such that it always presents the same face toward Earth when the two planets are at their closest approach. Whether this is a resonance effect or merely a coincidence is not known.”

> “Every 584 days, Venus and Earth come to their point of closest approach. And every time this happens, Venus shows Earth the same face. Is there some force that makes Venus align itself with the Earth rather than the Sun, or is this just a coincidence?”

> “Whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with Earth is unknown.”

> “Tidal locking of Venus planet: \[…\] so that the Venus planet shows always almost the same face to the Earth planet during each meeting, and shows that same face to both Earth and Sun during heliocentric opposition of Earth and Venus planets.”

Everyone knows of this, but who can explain it? In the TYCHOS this “puzzling” fact is considerably less mysterious. Venus, just like Mercury, is tidally locked with the Sun, quite simply because the two of them are moons of the Sun. Our own Moon, as we well know, is also tidally locked with its host planet.

Venus employs 584.4 days to circle the Sun once. This is somewhat longer than 1.5 solar years (365.25 X 1.5 = 547.875 days), the difference being:

584.4 – 547.875 = **36.525 days**

This is 1/10th of 365.25 days and 1/16th of 584.4 days. Why have I noted this?

As we will see further on, for every 16 solar revolutions around Earth, Venus conjuncts with the Sun 10 times (as seen from Earth). Hence, every 8 years, Venus conjuncts with the Sun 5 times. Every 16 years Venus aligns with Mars (albeit at diametrically opposed sides of Earth) and every 32 years or so Venus and Mars conjunct, this time on the same side of Earth.

The entire system is not just composed of magnetically-locked micro systems but is itself a perfectly synchronized system with each component relating to the other.

Venus has an 8-year cycle (2922 days) during which Venus completes 5 synodic periods of 584.4 days each (or 1.6 years).

365.25 X 8 = 2922 days

and

584.4 X 5 = 2922 days

As you may note for later, this is one hundred 29.22-day periods — _i.e.;_ our “TMSP”.

(The TMSP, our Moon’s True Mean Synodic Period of 29.22 days, will be expounded and illustrated in [Chapter 27](https://www.tychos.info/chapter-27/).)

### Verifying the TYCHOS average value of 584.4 days for Venus’ synodic period

Someone may object that the average Venus’ synodic period (as stated in official astronomy tables) is 583.9 days and not 584.4. I challenge the figure with the following evidence. Here is a series of five successive synodic periods which I have personally verified perusing the NEAVE Planetarium.

It is also something that anyone can easily verify for themselves. The synodic cycle of a planet is the number of days it takes for it to realign with the Sun as seen from Earth. All planets’ orbits are slightly **off-center** with respect to the body they revolve around (though please note this is entirely different from Kepler’s presumed “elliptical orbits” which do not exist as such in the TYCHOS).

These synodic period values fluctuate somewhat over time. We know that Venus realigns five times with the Sun in 8 years. We know that after 8 years, it roughly realigns with the Sun and the same star. Since we know these things, we should therefore obtain a more correct and significant mean synodic period by _averaging_ five synodic periods of Venus.

Total: 2922 days  
(or exactly 365.25 X 8)

Average length of Venus synodic period:

2922 / 5 = 584.4

The TYCHOS “584.4” value for the mean synodic period of Venus is thus beyond dispute, since it can be empirically observed.

As current theory has it, Venus rotates around its axis in a **clockwise** fashion. This, however, is an unproven claim which originates (much like the supposedly unreliable and “non-tidally-locked Mercury” story) from purported radar surveys performed back in the 1960’s. Countless debates about this specific issue can be found in astronomy literature yet none has ever reached a definitive conclusion about this matter.

In the TYCHOS, the reason why Venus appears to rotate around its axis in clockwise fashion is self-evident; since Venus employs more than one year (in fact, 1.6 solar years) to complete one rotation around its axis and to return to its perigee, Venus will appear (to an earthly observer) to rotate clockwise — that is, in the opposite direction of its revolution around Earth!
