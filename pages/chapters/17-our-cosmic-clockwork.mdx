“The Great Inequality” – solved by the TYCHOS 
=================================================================================

Back in the 18th century, the spiny question of the observed behavior of Jupiter and Saturn ignited a humongous and long-lasting debate among our world’s most celebrated astronomers and mathematicians (Halley, Flamsteed, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace and Poincaré, to name just a few). What every astronomy historian will know as “the Great Inequality” is a scientific saga of epic proportions. In short, the problem was that the motions of Jupiter and Saturn did not seem to obey either the Newtonian (gravitational) theory or the Keplerian (elliptical) theory. Not a trivial problem, you may say. Surely, Newton and Kepler couldn’t possibly both be wrong, could they?

What had been observed, first by Kepler himself and later by Halley, was that Jupiter appeared to accelerate while Saturn appeared to decelerate. This was truly ominous news for mankind: it meant, according to the Newtonian 'Laws' of gravity, that Jupiter would inevitably end up crashing into the Sun, while Saturn would be driven away into the depths of space! 

As we shall see, the TYCHOS can show that these apparent accelerations and decelerations were completely illusory - and that Jupiter and Saturn need not fear any imminent, catastrophic fate. But let's see how the eminent Astronomical Journal described this alarming 'discovery of the Great Inequality' - back in 1895:

Make no mistake, this was no petty matter: the very stability of our solar system was at stake! In fact, the Paris and Berlin Academies set up special prizes to encourage scientists to resolve the pesky and embarrassing matter. Leonhard Euler (the most acclaimed Swiss mathematician of all times) was the first recipient of such a prize, although his calculations showed _both_ Jupiter and Saturn accelerating, contrary to any astronomical observation ever made...

The magnificent Isaac Newton himself had recognized the problem of the apparent “instability” of our Solar System (on the grounds of the observed behavior of Jupiter and Saturn), but he never tackled the troublesome matter while basically saying (freely paraphrasing his words) that “God should take care of this problem in due time and restore the apparent, chaotic nature of our planetary motions”. Kepler also gave up looking into the matter - and admitted that only future generations may eventually unveil the mystery of our Solar System’s apparent instability (suggested by Jupiter and Saturn’s odd behavior). Kepler, for once, was right about that.

Enter Lagrange and Laplace, perhaps the two most acclaimed French “mathemagicians” of all times. The two French science icons engaged in a long struggle to try and justify the so-called Great Inequality, so as to rescue the sacrosanct Newtonian gravitational laws. Depending on what old text books one may bump into, it was either Lagrange or Laplace who “solved the problem”, basically concluding that (according to their formidably abstruse calculations) the so-called Great Inequality, i.e. the apparently increasing gap between Jupiter’s and Saturn’s celestial longitudes - was only a temporary phenomenon which would eventually reverse course. In other words, the gap would gradually (in the course of about nine hundred years) diminish and cancel out itself. Our Solar System was, after all, a stable one. Phew!

However, it is unclear just how Lagrange and Laplace reached their “mathemagical” conclusions. In academic text books, we may only find some dreadfully complex equations and computational wizardry based on mere assumptions about how “planetary/gravitational perturbations” and “tidal friction effects” might cause these puzzling inequalities. To be sure, under the Copernican model’s configuration there is no plausible explanation as to why Jupiter’s and Saturn’s celestial longitudes would oscillate back and forth, as observed. In time though - and here’s where it gets funny - Lagrange and Laplace were “proven right”: the apparent, relative accelerations/decelerations of Jupiter and Saturn were then observed, several decades later, as having reversed course:

From the mid-17th century the Great Anomaly appeared to go backwards: Saturn was accelerating and Jupiter was slowing down! Of course, such behavior was not compatible with a genuinely secular inequality.”_

One of the greatest observational astronomers of the times, William Herschel, had also noticed the “back and forth” oscillations of Jupiter and Saturn: “He [Herschel] describes Saturn’s period as increasing [i.e. Saturn seemed to be slowing down] during the seventeenth century, Jupiter’s period as diminishing [i.e. Jupiter seemed to be speeding up]: and he adds – ‘In the eighteenth century a process precisely the reverse seemed to be going on.’”
