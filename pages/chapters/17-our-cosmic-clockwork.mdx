Chapter 17 — Our Cosmic Clockwork and the “16 factor”
=====================================================

This brief chapter is, admittedly, rather speculative. It may however have its merits, insofar as it goes to highlight what one may call the 'clockwork nature' of our Solar System's workings. In any event, I personally find it fascinating how some sort of "16 factor" (or "common denominator") appears to pervade the celestial mechanics of our system. So if you will, let us take a short look at these numbers that seem to ask for our attention.       


**In 16 solar years (or 5844 days):**

**The SUN**  completes **16** orbits (1 solar revolution = 365.25 days)

**MARS**  completes **8** orbits (1 Mars revolution = 730.5 solar days)

**VENUS**  completes **10** synodic periods (1 Venus synodic period = 584.4 solar days)

**MERCURY**  completes **50** synodic periods (1 Mercury synodic period = 116.88 solar days)

**Our MOON**  completes **200** orbits around Earth (1 Moon TMSP = 29.22 solar days)

The below schematic plots the relative revolution periods (over a 16-year time span) of the Sun, Mars, Mercury, Venus and our Moon. Note once more that the orbital periods of our system’s celestial bodies are all exact multiples of the Moon’s “True Mean Synodic Period” (The TMSP of 29.22 days).

I have chosen this 16-year time span to illustrate our system’s relative motions (and its 'clockwork nature') for a reason: it would appear that the 16 factor is, for some reason, a pervasive feature of our system.

• Mars revolves around our system (from aphelion to perihelion) in about **16 years**.

• As Mars completes one of its orbits, it processes by **1/16th** of a solar year (22.828 days).

• Every 32 years (2 X **16**), Mars very nearly conjuncts with all of our system’s celestial bodies.

• Mercury regularly retrogrades for an average period of **1/16th** of a solar year (22.8 days).

• The Sun’s orbital speed (107.226 kmh) is extremely close to **16** X its rotational speed (6670 kmh).

• Our Moon’s Saros and Exegilmos cycles appear to be multiples of **16** Full Moon cycles.

• As it completes one Exegilmos cycle our Moon gains **1/16th** of a full 1440 minutes of RA.


Interestingly, the ubiquitous 16 factor extends as far as the very long time scales used in geology. Without going into geological considerations (which is beyond the scope of this book), the peculiar time period of 405,000 (+/- 500y) years is being widely used in geochronology, as it is held to be a particularly steady and significant “geological metronome” of sorts.

> “Only a few modeled planetary motions are stable enough for use as a metronome, for example, the 405-kyr orbital eccentricity cycle arising from the interaction of the secular frequencies g2-g5. Model stability studies by Laskar et al. (2004) suggest that the uncertainty of the ATS using this term alone will be at most only 0.1% at 100 Ma, and 0.2% at 250 Ma.”

> “Milankovitch cycles identified in sedimentary successions are being used to formulate an ‘Astronomical Time Scale’ (ATS) for the geologic record, with efforts well underway for the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras. Back through time, however, ATS resolving power declines due to uncertainties in the orbital solutions and Earth precession model. Prior to 50 Ma, only the modeled 405-kyr orbital eccentricity cycle retains high accuracy, leading to the idea for a ‘**405-kyr metronome**‘ to define the ATS for all geologic time. Radioisotope geochronology now offers a 2 sigma dating precision of 0.1%, which for Paleozoic time equates to an uncertainty on the order of 0.3 to 0.5 myr, i.e., comparable to the 405-kyr metronome resolution.”

In any case, if we divide 405,500 (the higher bound of that mean value) by the number of years in our TYCHOS Great Year we obtain:

405,500 / 25,344 ≈ **16**!

Here follows a conceptual graphic of the TYCHOS system I made while musing over the “mechanics” of our binary system:

Needless to say, the two cogs in my above graphic are just a figurative “thought exercise”. The big cog may represent, if you will, the combined magnetic fields of Sun and Mars exerting a “magnetic torque” on the smaller cog (Earth’s own magnetic field of opposed polarity), thus perhaps being responsible for Earth revolving in a clockwise/opposed direction to that of its companions. This is just a speculative electromagnetic musing of mine as to what may possibly go to explain Earth’s peculiar retrograde orbital motion.

In past decades, astronomers hunting for Earth-like exoplanets have discovered several planets nestled within binary systems featuring retrograde orbits – meaning that they revolve in the opposite direction of their host star.

> “Astronomers have discovered nine new transiting exoplanets. Surprisingly, six out of a larger sample of 27 were found to be orbiting in the opposite direction to the rotation of their host star — the exact reverse of what is seen in our own solar system. \[…’\]The new results really challenge the conventional wisdom that planets should always orbit in the same direction as their stars spin,’ says Andrew Cameron of the University of St Andrews, who presented the new results at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting (NAM2010) in Glasgow this week.”

These discoveries led the science community to a massive rethink of their models of planetary formation:

> “In just two decades, we have gone from knowing one planetary system (our own) to thousands, with 3268 exoplanets now known. This has driven a massive rethink of our models of planetary formation. \[…\] Then came another set of shocking discoveries. Rather than moving in the same plane as their host star’s equator, some Hot Jupiters turned out to have highly tilted orbits. **Some even move on retrograde orbits, in the opposite direction to their star’s rotation**.”

— [_Stars with planets on strange orbits: what’s going on?_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/073B_Strange-orbits.htm) by Brett Addison and Jonti Horner (2016)

Thus, Earth’s “retrograde” clockwise orbital motion is not overly exceptional, since it has been empirically observed that several other binary systems feature bodies revolving in the opposed orbital direction of their host stars.
