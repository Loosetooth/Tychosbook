“The Great Inequality” – delucidated by the TYCHOS 
=================================================================================

Back in the 18th century, the spiny question of the observed behavior of Jupiter and Saturn ignited a humongous and long-lasting debate among our world’s most celebrated astronomers and mathematicians (Halley, Flamsteed, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace and Poincaré, to name just a few). What every astronomy historian will know as “the Great Inequality” is a scientific saga of epic proportions. In short, the problem was that the motions of Jupiter and Saturn did not seem to obey either the Newtonian (gravitational) theory or the Keplerian (elliptical) theory. Not a trivial problem, you may say. Surely, Newton and Kepler couldn’t possibly both be wrong, could they?

What had been observed, first by Kepler himself and later by Halley, was that Jupiter appeared to accelerate while Saturn appeared to decelerate. This was truly ominous news for mankind: it meant, according to the Newtonian 'Laws' of gravity, that Jupiter would inevitably end up crashing into the Sun, while Saturn would be driven away into the depths of space! 

As we shall see, the TYCHOS can show that these apparent accelerations and decelerations were completely illusory - and that Jupiter and Saturn need not fear any imminent, catastrophic fate. But let's see how the eminent Astronomical Journal described this alarming 'discovery of the Great Inequality' - back in 1895:

Make no mistake, this was no petty matter: the very stability of our solar system was at stake! In fact, the Paris and Berlin Academies set up special prizes to encourage scientists to resolve the pesky and embarrassing matter. Leonhard Euler (the most acclaimed Swiss mathematician of all times) was the first recipient of such a prize, although his calculations showed _both_ Jupiter and Saturn accelerating, contrary to any astronomical observation ever made!

The magnificent Isaac Newton himself had recognized the problem of the apparent “instability” of our Solar System (on the grounds of the observed behavior of Jupiter and Saturn), but he never tackled the troublesome matter while basically saying (freely paraphrasing his words) that “God should take care of this problem in due time and restore the apparent, chaotic nature of our planetary motions”. Kepler also gave up looking into the matter - and admitted that only future generations may eventually unveil the mystery of our Solar System’s apparent instability (suggested by Jupiter and Saturn’s odd behavior). Kepler, for once, was right about that...

Now, what you need to know is that, as seen from Earth, Jupiter and Saturn appear to conjuct about every 60 years (or actually a whisker less than 60 years, due to Earth’s 1-mph motion). Since Jupiter employs 12 years to circle around us, while Saturn employs 30 years to do so, the two will regularly “meet up” every 60 years, i.e. 5 x 12 (=60) and 2 x 30 (=60), respectively. These 60-year conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn move around our celestial sphere in anti-clockwise manner, as illustrated below:

Here's another book extract describing the most worrisome "Great Inequality" that had all of the astronomers of the time on their toes:

Enter Lagrange and Laplace, perhaps the two most acclaimed French mathematicians of all times. The two French science icons engaged in a long struggle to try and resolve the so-called Great Inequality - in order to rescue the sacrosanct Newtonian gravitational laws. Depending on what old text books one may bump into, it was either Lagrange or Laplace who “solved the problem”, basically concluding that (according to their formidably abstruse calculations) the so-called Great Inequality - i.e. the apparently increasing gap between Jupiter’s and Saturn’s celestial longitudes - was only a temporary phenomenon which would eventually reverse course. In other words, the gap would gradually (in the course of about nine hundred years) diminish and cancel out itself. Our Solar System was, after all, a stable one. Phew!

However, it is unclear just how Lagrange and Laplace reached their “mathemagical” conclusions. In academic text books, we may only find some dreadfully complex equations and computational wizardry based on mere assumptions about how _“gravitational perturbations”_ and _“tidal friction effects”_ might cause those puzzling inequalities. As it is, under the Copernican model’s configuration there is no plausible explanation as to why Jupiter’s and Saturn’s celestial longitudes would oscillate back and forth, as observed. In time though - and here’s where it gets funny - Lagrange and Laplace were eventually “proven right”: the apparent, relative accelerations/decelerations of Jupiter and Saturn were then observed, several decades later, as having reversed course:

> _“In 1773, Lambert used advanced perturbation techniques to produce new tables of Jupiter and Saturn.The result was surprising. From the mid-17th century the Great Anomaly appeared to go backwards: Saturn was accelerating and Jupiter was slowing down! Of course, such behavior was not compatible with a genuinely secular inequality.”_

One of the greatest observational astronomers of the times, William Herschel, had also noticed the “back and forth” oscillations of Jupiter and Saturn: “He [Herschel] describes Saturn’s period as increasing (i.e. Saturn seemed to be slowing down) during the seventeenth century - and Jupiter’s period as diminishing (i.e. Jupiter seemed to be speeding up) and he adds – ‘In the eighteenth century a process precisely the reverse seemed to be going on.’”

So, after all, there was no apocalyptic scenario whatsoever for humanity to fear. Nonetheless, as pointed out by a number of contemporary independent researchers, the “Great Inequality” and its corollary, the very “Stability of our Solar System”, both remain - to this very day - unsolved riddles. For instance, here’s what Antonio Giorgilli (a veteran Italian expert in this peculiar area of astronomical studies and the author of “The Stability of the Solar System: Three Centuries of Mathematics”) warns the reader with:

_“Su queste basi cercherò di illustrare che significato si possa dare alla domanda: “il sistema solare è stabile?”[...] Quanto alla risposta, non vorrei deludere nessuno, ma sarà: non lo sappiamo”._

("On this basis I will try to illustrate what meaning can be given to the question: "Is the solar system stable?"[...] As for the answer, I do not want to disappoint anyone, but it will be: we do not know".)

"We do not know"... Well, we obviously cannot attain any firm knowledge of our solar system’s behavior if we haven’t even envisioned its correct geometric layout, can we? As I will presently illustrate, the TYCHOS model’s geometric layout provides the simplest imaginable explanation for the “Great Inequality”.

Now that we have taken a look at some historical controversies surrounding the "mysterious variations of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn", let’s see how the Tychos model can account - in the simplest possible manner - for the so-called “Great Inequality”. My below graphic should clarify conceptually what causes the so-called “Great Inequality”.

1: Whenever (in a certain epoch) Jupiter and Saturn are observed, over a 60-year interval, to conjunct in the “upper quadrant” of our celestial sphere, it will seem as if Jupiter is accelerating.

2: Whenever (in a certain epoch) Jupiter and Saturn are observed, over a 60-year interval, to conjunct in the “lower quadrant” of our celestial sphere, it will seem as if Saturn is accelerating.

This is because, as Earth moves slowly (at 1 mph) around its PVP orbit, Jupiter and Saturn will alternately conjunct as they proceed in the opposite or in the same direction as Earth. 

Antonio Giorgilli then points out something of paramount interest to the Tychos model’s paradigm. Here’s another quote from his aforementioned paper (“The Stability of the Solar System: Three Centuries of Mathematics”):

> _“The first long-term simulations have been carried out since the end of the 1980s by some researchers, including A. Milani, M. Carpino, A. Nobili, GJ Sussman, J. Wisdom, J. Laskar. Their conclusions can be summarized as follows: the four major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) seem to move quite regularly even over a period of a few billion years, which is the estimated age of our Solar System. On the other hand, the internal planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) present small random orbital variations, in particular of their eccentricity, which cannot be interpreted as periodic movements: we must admit that there is a chaotic component. Not that the orbits change much, at least not in the short term, but there may be, for example, small variations in the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit that have very significant effects on the climate: the glaciations appear to be correlated with these variations.”_

In other words, this nicely goes to confirm that, as proposed by the Tychos, there are two distinct groups of celestial bodies in our Solar System:

1. The Binary group (or “the inner orbs”) composed of the Sun, Mars, Mercury and Venus (and of course, the central Earth-Moon system).

2. The P-type group (or “circumbinary orbs”) composed of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune - and Pluto.

And thus, in the simplest possible fashion, the Tychos model resolves yet another historical impasse of astronomy: “The Great Inequality".
