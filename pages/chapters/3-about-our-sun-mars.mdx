
Chapter 3 — About our Sun-Mars binary system
============================================

<div class=text-justify> The first objection people will have to the idea that Mars is the Sun's binary companion usually goes like this: _"Nonsense! Mars isn't even considered to be a star - but a planet!"_ True: modern astronomers do indeed refer to Mars as a 'planet' (even though, as we shall see, Kepler himself called Mars a 'star', i.e. "STELLAE MARTIS" in Latin). However, as mentioned in Chapter 2, it is a little-known fact that many stars do not shine with their own light: for instance, many red and brown dwarfs are so dim that they remain completely invisible even to our largest telescopes. To be sure, the so-called red dwarfs are the most common 'stars' in our skies:</div> 

> _"Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. From Earth, not one star that fits the stricter definitions of a red dwarf is visible to the naked eye."_
— [Red dwarf (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) 

Now, no one can deny that Mars is the only reddish-orange body in our Solar System - even though our naked eyes see Mars shining just like a (huge) star. Yet, any amateur astronomers can easily verify for themselves that Mars is a reddish-orange sphere (unlike any of the other planets in our Solar System).

You may now ask:_"how do we even know about the existence of invisible 'dwarf stars'?"_ (i.e. those invisible even to our largest telescopes). Well, we know this thanks to sophisticated apparels called spectroscopes which are, in fact, routinely used to detect invisible companions of larger stars. The below book extract (by Cecil G. Dolmage) succintly describes the basic workings of the spectroscope:  

> _"There are certain stars which always appear single even in the largest telescopes, but when the spectroscope is directed to them a spectrum with two sets of lines is seen. Such stars must, therefore, be double. Further, if the shiftings of the lines, in a spectrum like this, tell us that the component stars are making small movements to and from us which go on continuously, we are therefore justified in concluding that these are the orbital revolutions of a binary system greatly compressed by distance. Such connected pairs of stars, since they cannot be seen separately by means of any telescope, no matter how large, are known as "spectroscopic binaries."_

However, it should be noted that even spectroscopes will fail to determine whether star companions detected in such manner shine with their own light:  

> _"In observations of spectroscopic binaries we do not always get a double spectrum. Indeed, if one of the components be below a certain magnitude, its spectrum will not appear at all; **and so we are left in the strange uncertainty as to whether this component is merely faint or actually dark**. It is, however, from the shiftings of the lines in the spectrum of the other component that we see that an orbital movement is going on, and are thus enabled to conclude that two bodies are here connected into a system, although one of these bodies resolutely refuses directly to reveal itself even to the all-conquering spectroscope."_

Today, we know that the _vast majority_ of our visible stars have one (or more) invisible companions - and astronomers are incessantly discovering new binary systems at an ever-increasing rate. Surely, this has to be the most significant, paradigm-changing astronomical epiphany of our modern age? One can only wonder why such persistent findings haven’t yet sparked a major debate questioning the 'implicit exceptionalism' of the Copernican heliocentric theory - what with its unique, companionless 'non-binary' star (the Sun) and its gigantic 240-million-year orbit.     

Having said that, there does appear to be some growing realization (within select astronomy circles) concerning the improbable notion that the Sun would be such an exceptional, solitary star. Here's, for instance, a short extract from an article published at the Science Alert website (November 2018):

“_Our Sun is a solitary star, all on its ownsome, which makes it something of an oddball. But there’s evidence to suggest that it did have a binary twin, once upon a time. Recent research suggests that most, if not all, stars are born with a binary twin. (We already knew the Solar System is a total weirdo. The placement of the planets appears out of whack compared to other systems, and it’s missing the most common planet in the galaxy, the super-Earth.)_"
-[Science Alert (Nov 20, 2018)](https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-found-our-sun-s-long-lost-identical-twin-star) 

Another article published in June 2017 at the PhysOrg website carries this most interesting title: **"New evidence that all stars are born in pairs".**

> _"Astronomers have speculated about the origins of binary and multiple star systems for hundreds of years, and in recent years have created computer simulations of collapsing masses of gas to understand how they condense under gravity into stars. They have also simulated the interaction of many young stars recently freed from their gas clouds. Several years ago, one such computer simulation by Pavel Kroupa of the University of Bonn led him to conclude that all stars are born as binaries.(...) **We now believe that most stars, which are quite similar to our own sun, form as binaries. I think we have the strongest evidence to date for such an assertion."**_
-["New evidence that all stars are born in pairs" (June 14, 2017)](https://phys.org/news/2017-06-evidence-stars-born-pairs.html)

Wow - that is mighty interesting, isn’t it? If all stars are born in pairs, _how and why_ did our Sun separate from its original companion? Did our Sun get a divorce on the grounds of its partner’s infidelity? Was it a consensual separation? Or did they part ways due to cosmic perturbations / turbulences messing up their primordial, magnetic relationship? Oh, well, it happens all the time between human beings, doesn’t it? Jokes aside, if it were eventually found that _all the stars in our universe have a binary companion_, this would have truly profound implications for the entire realm of astrophysics - and this isn't just my personal opinion: it was none other than Jacobus Kapteyn (arguably the world's all-time top expert in stellar distributions) that famously stated at the end of his illustrious career that...  

_“...if all stars were binaries there would be no need to invoke ‘dark matter’ in the Universe.”_

I trust that every one of you readers has heard of “dark matter”. It is some elusive / invisible (and entirely postulated) “substance” that our modern astrophysicists and cosmologists are desperately trying to find in our universe - yet, so far, with little luck. They currently contend that about 80% or more of our universe is made of this hitherto undetectable “dark matter” ― or, if you will, “missing matter” ― because the observed, highly scattered distributions and inexplicable motions of our universe’s celestial bodies appear to violate _**both**_ Kepler’s and Newton’s hallowed laws (as well as the infamous “Big Bang” theory). Here are a couple of extracts from a Wikipedia page titled “Galaxy rotation curve” (my bolds):

_“Since observations of galaxy rotation **do not match the distribution expected from application of Kepler's laws**, they do not match the distribution of luminous matter. This implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or, in alternative, the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales._" 

[...] _These results suggested that **either Newtonian gravity does not apply universally** or that, conservatively, upwards of 50% of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo.”_

Evidently, both Kepler's and Newton's "long-established laws" (on which much of our modern science is based upon) have some serious problems nowadays. Yet, the world's scientific community doesn't seem to worry too much about it!    

### The intersecting orbits of Sun and Mars : a typical binary system

Below is one of my earliest TYCHOS graphics (2013) as I tried to wrap my head around the proposed geometry of Tycho Brahe’s geoheliocentric model. At the time, I wasn’t even aware that binary systems were by far the most common star formations in our skies. But then again – as already mentioned – neither was the great Tycho Brahe back in his days. Little did I know that this early, tentative diagram would actually stand the test of time...

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/010_SSSS_SunMars_2013.jpg)

NOTE: my above graphic is meant to be a “3/4 view” of our system – as if we were approaching our solar system in an imaginary spaceship at an angle, roughly at 45° above the “March / December” side. Hence, the apparent elliptical shapes of the Sun / Mars orbits are only a matter of perspective. In the TYCHOS model, ALL the orbits of our system’s bodies are uniformly circular.

Note also that, in my above graphic, Earth is still lacking an orbit of its own. Yet, we shall soon see how this earthly orbit unfolds in the TYCHOS model - due to the slow precessional motion of our binary system around its common barycentre. I have earnestly strived to document a progressive, step-by-step account of my thought processes, as the TYCHOS model gradually took shape in my mind. In such way, I hope it will be easier for the reader to follow the methodological path which led me to formulate its logical conclusions.

Let us begin with a classic binary star system - as previously illustrated in Chapter 1.

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/011_binary_stars_ORBIT_01.jpg)

Notice that, if we substitute the above “high mass star” and “low mass star” with the SUN and MARS respectively (as I have done in the below adaptation) we obtain a neatly-balanced binary system that incorporates the two moons of the Sun (Mercury and Venus) and the two moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos).

In addition, please separately observe the additional “plot twist” of paramount interest to us Earthlings:

**In the TYCHOS, Earth is positioned near (or at) the center of mass of the Sun-Mars binary system.**

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/012_binary_stars_ORBIT_TYCHOSSSS.jpg)

 
We can see just how harmonious such a binary system would be: Earth embraced by the Sun-Mars binary duo, each of the two binary companions hosting a pair of lunar satellites. Let us now take a proper look at these two pairs of moons hosted by the Sun and Mars. 


**COMPARING THE MOONS OF THE SUN AND MARS**

In the TYCHOS model, Mercury and Venus are the Sun’s two tidally-locked moons. Similarly, Mars also has two (lesser-known) tidally-locked moons: Phobos and Deimos, which were only discovered as recently as 1877 by Asaph Hall. (Tycho Brahe never observed them).

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/013_Moons_of_Sun_and_Mars_02.jpg)


A closer look at the moons of Mars brings up some interesting interrelationships with their bigger sisters Mercury and Venus. Under the Copernican model (where Mars is just another planet orbiting around the Sun) there would be no conceivable motive for these four celestial bodies to exhibit any sort of 'sympathy' with each other. In the TYCHOS model, on the other hand, this is just one of many 'harmonious resonances' that seem to pervade our Solar System - as will be thoroughly expounded further on. 

Consider these comparative facts about the moons of the Sun (Mercury and Venus) and the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos).

Mercury’s diameter is 2.5X smaller than Venus’ diameter.  
Phobos’ orbital diameter is 2.5X smaller than Deimos’ orbital diameter.

Deimos’ diameter is 1.8X smaller than Phobos’ diameter.  
Mercury’s orbital diameter is 1.8X smaller than Venus’ orbital diameter.

Curious, isn't it? To my knowledge, you won't find any mention of these remarkable 'reciprocities' in astronomy literature. Furthermore:

Each year, Mercury revolves ca. 3.13 times around the Sun; whereas each day, Phobos revolves 3.13 times around Mars. As a way of comparison, think of the Sun that revolves once every year around Earth, whereas Earth rotates once every day around its axis. This may sound like a bizarre comparison (between a revolution period and a rotational period), unless you know that our Moon revolves around Earth in the same time as the Sun rotates around its axis (approx 27.3 days).

Mercury orbits the Sun near-precisely 5X faster than Venus, while Phobos orbits Mars near-precisely 4X faster than Deimos. The ratios are extremely close to whole numbers, and congruent with the concept of non-relativistic time. That is to say, assuming no Einsteinian “time warp”, these systems are directly interlocked with one another in real time.

All this appears to indicate some sort of 'kinship' between these two pairs of moons (of the Sun & Mars) which, under the Copernican model, would have to be attributed to some sort of random, “accidental happenstance”. Conversely, under the TYCHOS model, all this can be interpreted as a natural consequence of Mercury and Venus & Phobos and Deimos being, respectively, the moons of the Sun and the moons of Mars.

You might now rightly ask yourself, “Why are Mercury and Venus the only ‘planets’ of our solar system **with no moons of their own?**”

As a matter of fact, this is one of astronomy’s longstanding (and still unsolved) mysteries. The truth of the matter is: no one actually knows why Venus and Mercury are “moonless”. To dismiss the absence by calling it happenstance doesn’t make the question go away. Meanwhile, no compelling theses on this spiny subject have been forthcoming to this day. Here are, for instance, NASA’s (timid and tentative) explanations of this major cosmic enigma.

> _“Most likely because they are too close to the Sun. Any moon with too great a distance from these planets would be in an unstable orbit and be captured by the Sun. If they were too close to these planets they would be destroyed by tidal gravitational forces. The zones where moons around these planets could be stable over billions of years is probably so narrow that no body was ever captured into orbit, or created in situ when the planets were first being accreted.”_
— [Why don’t Mercury and Venus have moons?](https://www.tychos.info/citation/013A_Astronomy-Answers.htm)_ by NASA for Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) Education Center

Here’s another (perhaps more intellectually honest) quote from another nasa.gov website:

> _“Why Venus doesn’t have a moon is a mystery for scientists to solve.”_
[How many moons?](https://www.tychos.info/citation/014A_Space-Place.htm)_ by Kristen Erickson (2017) for NASA Space Place

As it is, the TYCHOS model has a short answer to this “mystery”: Venus and Mercury have no moons due to the simple fact that they **_are_** moons. Moreover, they are the two moons of the Sun much like Mars, its binary companion, also has two moons. In fact, the notion that Venus and Mercury are moons (rather than planets) can be deduced and backed up in multiple ways. The first method has to do with their distinctively slow axial rotation speeds, which both appear to be ‘intimately related’ to the slowly-rotating Moon of Earth:


**ROTATIONAL VELOCITIES OF OUR MOON, MERCURY AND VENUS (as computed in the TYCHOS model)**

- The rotational speed of our Moon (as of official data) is no more than **16.7 km/h**

- The rotational speed of Mercury (as of the TYCHOS\*) is no more than **5.465km/h** (almost exactly 3X slower than our Moon!)

- The rotational speed of Venus (as of the TYCHOS\*\*) is no more than **2.711km/h** (almost exactly 6X slower than our Moon!)


*Mercury returns to perigee in 116.88 days (or 2805 hours). Mercury’s circumference is 15,329 km. Hence, a distance of 15,329 km covered in 2805 hours computes to a rotational speed of: 15,329 km / 2805 hours = **5.465 km/h**

\*\*Venus returns to perigee in 584.4 days (or 14,025.6 hours). Venus’ circumference is 38,024.5 km. Hence, a distance of 38,024.5 km covered in 14,025.6 hours computes to a rotational speed of: 38,024.5 km / 14,025.6 hours = **2.711 km/h**

These are all, of course, _**exceptionally slow**_ rotational speeds - as compared to all other celestial bodies. They are all in the rotational speed range of a children’s merry-go-round.  

To verify the latter assertion, let us ask ourselves: _“Do any other celestial bodies in our system have such extremely slow rotational speeds as our Moon, Mercury or Venus?”_ The answer is no. For instance, Jupiter rotates around its axis at a brisk _43,000 km/h_ and Saturn rotates around its axis at about _35,000 km/h_. These are, of course, hypersonic speeds completely unlike the 'snail-paced' lunar rotational speeds. And what about Mars's rotational speed? We shall see about that later, as Mars’s axial rotation turns out to be synchronous with Earth’s axial rotation.


**DEFINITION OF A "MOON" (or "lunar body")**

In view of all the above considerations, we may thus formulate a set of peculiar properties which distinguish a 'moon' from a 'planet': 

1\. No moons have satellites of their own, since they are moons themselves.

2\. A moon’s rotation is always tidally locked to its host’s nucleus, and this remains independent of its host’s rate of axial rotation.

3\. A moon rotates _exceptionally slowly_ around its own axis – compared with all other known celestial bodies.


Incidentally - and as a final consideration - if our three nearmost moons (our Moon, Mercury and Venus) are “locked” in a 1:3:6 **_rotational_** resonance, this is reminiscent of the well-known 1:2:4 **_orbital_** resonance of the three largest moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa and Ganymede):

In the next chapter, we will look at the astonishing similarities between the Sun/Mars binary system and the SiriusA/SiriusB binary system.
