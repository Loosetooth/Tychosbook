Chapter 20: THE 811000-YEAR MEGA CYCLE
========================================================


As we saw in Chapter 16, our Solar System appears to have a long cycle of 811000 years - at both  ends of which all the ‘inner’ bodies of our system (Sun, Mars, Mercury, Venus, the Earth and our Moon) return to the almost exact same celestial positions (as can be verified in the Tychosium simulator). The question is: why would this be? Can we find any sort of correlation between this long period and other observed cosmic motions?

Before we proceed any further, this should be a good time to address another question with regards to the Tychosium simulator (TS) that readers may have on their minds: does the TS agree with other (heliocentric) solar system simulators – over very long time periods? The answer to this question is 'yes and no', for they all disagree with each other to some extent. However, there is one particular simulator (the "JS Orrery") that is of particular interest to the TYCHOS model, because its graphic construct / layout is quite similar to that of the TS. The man credited with providing the exacting algorithms and ephemeride tables for the JS Orrery happens to be Paul Schlyter, a veteran Swedish astronomer who - a few years ago - spent several months corresponding via e-mail with yours truly and Patrik Holmqvist, the computer-programmer of the TS - and my closest collaborator. According to Schlyter (a staunch heliocentrist) our TS simulator was doomed to failure and would never reach the sort of accuracy attained by the JS Orrery. Well, let’s see how the two simulators compare over longer periods of time:

The below two pairs of screenshots (from the Tychosium and the JS Orrery) compare the relative positions of the Sun, Mars, Earth, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter on June 21, 1915 – and on June 21, 25344, as depicted in the two simulators:

As you can see, the two simulators remain in excellent agreement - over a time span of more than 23000 years. Patrik Holmqvist and I are now satisfied that the TS is at least as reliable as any of the most popular heliocentric solar system simulators (in predicting secular planetary positions). Best of all, the Tychosium can do so while fully respecting (and being consistent with) the observed conjunctions between our planets and the distant stars – unlike any existing heliocentric simulators such as the JS orrery.   

## The 811000-year cycle of our Solar System and the Sirius system 

In Chapter 6, I speculated about the possibility of the Sirius system being the “double-double” bina-ry companion of our Solar System. As the 811000-year cycle came to light, I decided to put to this theory to the test – using what is currently known about Sirius (through its observational data and predicted celestial motions). Sirius is observed to move towards our Solar System and is expected to become our South Pole star in roughly 60000 years from now. The problem with this prediction is that, if Sirius were to be as distant as 8.6 light years (and moving towards us at a radial velocity of 5.5 km/s, as officially stated), it would employ more than 469000 years to reach the “X vector” of our Solar System’s ecliptic. Clearly, the official predictions don’t add up - and something else must be going on. For the purpose of my research though, I chose to use that “60000-year” prediction (for Sirius becoming our South Pole star) as computed by the famed mathematical astronomer Jean Meeus,   

Now, if the Sirius system were to be our Solar System’s binary companion, it would make sense that its ‘long orbit’ is of similar size to ours. So I decided, for my geometric experiment, to draw two ‘wheels’ divided in 16 slices of 50688 years (50688 X 16 ~ 811000), overlapping the two in classic binary fashion. Incidentally, and as you may recall from Chapter 16, 50688 years (i.e. 2 X 25344) is the “Great Year of Mars”. 

The outcome of this geometric experiment of mine (which surpassed my wildest expectations) is for all to see: our Solar System and the Sirius system will complete a full revolution around each other and return in the same relative positions in just about 811000 years. Moreover, as predicted by Jean Meeus, Sirius will become our South pole star approximately 60000 years from now (as the Earth completes another half-turn around its 25344-year PVP orbit):

We may therefore conclude that the many independent researchers who have proposed that Sirius is the binary companion of the Sun have been right all along, Should our world’s academic / scientific community continue to ignore the available evidence pointing to this manifest state of affairs, we may justly accuse them of ‘denialism’.      

## About the ‘magnetic pole reversals’ of the Sun and the Earth 

Let’s first take a look at the Sun’s “magnetic field reversal” period - as of the official reckoning :

_During what is known as the solar cycle, the magnetic field of the Sun has reversed every 11 years over the past centuries. This flip, where the south magnetic pole switches to north and vice versa, occurs during the peak of each solar cycle and originates from a process called a “dynamo”._ [3D simulations reveals why the Sun flips its magnetic field every 11 years](https://insider.si.edu/2017/07/3d-simulations-reveals-sun-flips-magnetic-field-every-11-years/#:~:text=During%20what%20is%20known%20as,process%20called%20a%20%E2%80%9Cdynamo%E2%80%9D.)

So the Sun’s magnetic field apparently reverses in the very short period of 11 years. However, this is not an exact period since this period can vary from 9 to 14 years:

_“Most people think of the solar cycle as having a fixed length of 11 years. This is not strictly true as cycles vary considerably in length from as little as 9 years to almost 14 years.”_ [The Length of the Solar Cycle](https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Educational/2/3/7) 

It would therefore be more correct to say that the mean of this Solar Cycle amounts to about **11.5** years (9+14=23/2=11.5).

Do scientists have any clue as to exactly why this Solar Cycle exists? Well, no:

_“If you’re confused about the sun’s impending magnetic field flip, don’t feel bad — scientists don’t fully understand it, either. The sun’s magnetic field will reverse its polarity three or four months from now, researchers say, just as it does every 11 years at the peak of the solar activity cycle. While solar physicists know enough about this strange phenomenon to predict when it will occur, its ultimate causes remain mysterious.”_ [What Causes the Sun’s Magnetic Field Flip?](https://www.space.com/22310-sun-magnetic-field-flip-mystery.html) 

In Chapter 16, we saw that the most recent geomagnetic reversal of the Earth’s poles occurred roughly 800000 years ago. More precisely, what is known as the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal is reckoned to have occurred 781000 years ago.

In the TYCHOS model, the Earth’s orbital speed (1.601169 km/h) is a mere 0.00149326% of the Sun’s orbital speed (107226 km/h). So let’s see how this pans out mathematically - with respect to the magnetic reversals of the Sun and the Earth:

0.00149326% of 781000 years amounts to **11.66** years 

In other words, it would appear that the magnetic reversals of the Sun and the Earth are regulated by - and are commensurate to - their respective orbital speeds! This sort of realization is, of course, only possible when viewed through the TYCHOS 'lens'.
