Chapter 16 — Our Cosmic Clockwork and the “16 factor”
=====================================================

This chapter is, admittedly, fairly speculative. It may however have its merits - and may appeal to horologists - insofar as it goes to highlight what one may call the 'clockwork nature' of our Solar System's workings. Those familiar with the wondrous Antikythera orrery should find it interesting to consider that it may not have been such a complex mechanism after all - as it would have required (under the TYCHOS paradigm) far less gears and cogs than currently believed (or/and hotly debated). To be sure, one of the biggest controversies surrounding the Antikythera mechanism is how so many gears could possibly have been fitted in such a small box.

>"The Antikythera mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks.(...) There is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives."

In any event, I personally find it fascinating how some sort of "16 factor" (or "common denominator") appears to pervade the celestial mechanics of our system. So if you will, let us take a short look at this "16 factor" that seems to be crying out for our attention.       


### In 16 solar years (or 5844 days):**

**The SUN**  completes **16** orbits (1 solar revolution = 365.25 days)

**MARS**  completes **8** orbits (1 Mars revolution = 730.5 solar days)

**VENUS**  completes **10** synodic periods (1 Venus synodic period = 584.4 solar days)

**MERCURY**  completes **50** synodic periods (1 Mercury synodic period = 116.88 solar days)

**Our MOON**  completes **200** orbits around Earth (1 Moon TMSP = 29.22 solar days)

The below schematic plots the relative revolution periods (over a 16-year time span) of the Sun, Mars, Mercury, Venus and our Moon. Note once more that the orbital periods of our system’s celestial bodies are all near-exact multiples of the Moon’s “True Mean Synodic Period” (The TMSP of 29.22 days).

_The above diagram is, of course, not showing any actual planetary motions / trajectories; it is only a conceptual way of illustrating the relative orbital ratios of the celestial bodies composing our “cosmic clockwork”._

Here's a shortlist (by no means exhaustive) of diverse occurences of the "16 factor" in our Solar System:

• Mars revolves around our system (from aphelion to perihelion) in about **16 years**.

• As Mars completes one of its orbits, it processes by about **1/16th** of a solar year (22.828 days).

• Venus and Mars regularly re-conjunct every **16 years** - on either side of Earth.

• Mercury regularly retrogrades for an average period of **1/16th** of a solar year (22.8 days).

• The Sun’s orbital speed (107.226 kmh) is extremely close to **16** X its rotational speed (6670 kmh).

• The Moon's famous Saros cycle of 6585.3211 days is nearly equal to **16** Full Moon cycles of 411.78433 days.

• As it completes one Exegilmos cycle, our Moon gains **1/16th** of 1440 minutes of RA (our celestial sphere).


Here follows another conceptual graphic of the TYCHOS system I made while musing over the possible “electromagnetic-mechanics” of the same. At this time, I have no pretense to formulate any 'TOE' (Theory Of Everything) to explain the motions of our Universe - yet I hope that the TYCHOS model might encourage open-minded astrophysicists to consider that magnetic (rather than 'gravitational') forces are at play - thus accounting for the wondrous 'clockwork nature' of our system:

Needless to say, the two cogs (or gears) in my above graphic are merely figurative elements of the diagram: the big cog may represent, if you will, the combined magnetic fields of Sun and Mars exerting a “magnetic counter-torque” on the smaller cog (Earth’s own magnetic field of opposed polarity), thus perhaps being responsible for Earth revolving in the opposed direction of our entire Solar System. In the early days of my TYCHOS research, this 'clockwise' motion of our planet caused me much perplexity - and I feared that it might expose my fledgling TYCHOS model to instant ridicule! At the time, I thought that no such retrograde orbits had ever been observed in our cosmos. In recent decades however, astronomers hunting for Earth-like exoplanets have discovered several orbs nestled within binary systems featuring retrograde orbits – _meaning that they revolve in the opposite direction of their host star_:

> “Astronomers have discovered nine new transiting exoplanets. Surprisingly, six out of a larger sample of 27 were found to be orbiting in the opposite direction to the rotation of their host star — the exact reverse of what is seen in our own solar system. \[…’\]The new results really challenge the conventional wisdom that planets should always orbit in the same direction as their stars spin,’ says Andrew Cameron of the University of St Andrews, who presented the new results at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting (NAM2010) in Glasgow this week.”

— _[Turning planetary theory upside down: Nine new exoplanets found, some with retrograde orbits](https://www.tychos.info/citation/073A_Star-spin.htm)_ by ESO (2010)

These discoveries led the science community to a massive rethink of their models of planetary formation:

> “In just two decades, we have gone from knowing one planetary system (our own) to thousands, with 3268 exoplanets now known. This has driven a massive rethink of our models of planetary formation. \[…\] Then came another set of shocking discoveries. Rather than moving in the same plane as their host star’s equator, some Hot Jupiters turned out to have highly tilted orbits. **Some even move on retrograde orbits, in the opposite direction to their star’s rotation**.”

— [_Stars with planets on strange orbits: what’s going on?_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/073B_Strange-orbits.htm) by Brett Addison and Jonti Horner (2016)

Thus, Earth’s retrograde / clockwise orbital motion (as of the TYCHOS) is not overly exceptional, since it has been empirically observed that several other binary systems feature bodies revolving in the opposed orbital direction of their host stars.


**The "16 factor" - and the TYCHOS' proposed Great Year duration of 25344 years**

Interestingly, this apparently ubiquitous 16 factor extends as far as the very long time scales used in geology. Without going into geological considerations (which is beyond the scope of this book), please know that the peculiar time period of 405,000 (+/- 500y) years is being widely used today in geochronology, as it is held to be a particularly steady and significant “geological metronome” of sorts. 

> “Long term calculations of Earth’s orbital eccentricity show that the component averaging **405,000** years is very steady and can be used to date geological formations for the last 23 million years”.

> “Only a few modeled planetary motions are stable enough for use as a metronome, for example, the 405-kyr orbital eccentricity cycle arising from the interaction of the secular frequencies g2-g5. Model stability studies by Laskar et al. (2004) suggest that the uncertainty of the ATS using this term alone will be at most only 0.1% at 100 Ma, and 0.2% at 250 Ma.”

— _[Precision and Accuracy of the ATS](https://www.tychos.info/citation/072B_Earth-time.htm)_, Earth Time (2006)

> “Milankovitch cycles identified in sedimentary successions are being used to formulate an ‘Astronomical Time Scale’ (ATS) for the geologic record, with efforts well underway for the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras. Back through time, however, ATS resolving power declines due to uncertainties in the orbital solutions and Earth precession model. Prior to 50 Ma, only the modeled 405-kyr orbital eccentricity cycle retains high accuracy, leading to the idea for a ‘**405-kyr metronome**‘ to define the ATS for all geologic time. Radioisotope geochronology now offers a 2 sigma dating precision of 0.1%, which for Paleozoic time equates to an uncertainty on the order of 0.3 to 0.5 myr, i.e., comparable to the 405-kyr metronome resolution.”

Further reading on the 405,000 (+/-500y) year geological cycle may be found in papers such as:

_[Time-calibrated Milankovitch cycles for the late Permian](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3452)_ by Huaichun Wu, Shihong Zhang, Linda A. Hinnov, Ganqing Jiang, Qinglai Feng, Haiyan Li & Tianshui Yang (13 September 2013) for Nature Communications volume 4

_[Hunting for the 405-kyr eccentricity cycle phase at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary in the Aïn Settara section (Kalaat Senan, central Tunisia)](http://paleopolis.rediris.es/cg/CG2012_A05/)_ by Michel Hennebert (May 21, 2012)

Now, if we divide 405,500 (the higher bound of that mean value) by 25344, we obtain:

405,500y / 25,344y ≈ **16**!

In other words, the "16 factor" would even appear to support (at a long-term, geological level) the proposed duration of the Great Year of 25344 solar years - as proposed by the TYCHOS model!
