Chapter 7 — The Copernican model is geometrically impossible
============================================================

It is a widely-held misconception that heliocentric and geocentric models are equally valid and viable. However, there can only be one correct interpretation of our celestial mechanics and geometry that unfailingly predicts for all the interactions between our Solar System’s companions vis-à-vis the more distant stars. Through sound logic, induction and deductive reasoning (“à-la-Sherlock Holmes”) we should be able to discard the impossible hypotheses and retain the sole configuration which makes physical, geometrical, mechanical and optical sense, and is consistent at all times with empirical observation when tested.

And here is where the Copernican theory miserably falls apart. As you will see, what follows categorically disqualifies the Copernican model as a viable proposition, since its proposed geometry isn’t only problematic or questionable. It is outright impossible, unless you rewrite fantastic physical laws to excuse it. I shall demonstrate this fact with the following, exemplary case.

On November 5, 2018 we will see Mars aligned with the star **Delta Capricorni (_a.k.a._ “Deneb Algedi”)**. Then, 546 days later, when according to the Copernican model Earth will find itself on the opposite side of its orbit, Mars will **_once again_** (as viewed from Earth) align with the star Delta Capricorni!

There are two types of planetariums we may take astronomical data from. One attempts to simulate the orbital motions of our planets and moons as of the Copernican system, (such as the [JS ORRERY](https://mgvez.github.io/jsorrery/) or the [SCOPE planetarium](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/)) which feature an “overhead” view of our system, as if we were looking at it from above our North Pole. The other type of planetariums (such as [STELLARIUM](https://stellarium-web.org/) or the now defunct NEAVE planetarium) is considerably more realistic and verifiable, as they simulate our stars’ and planets’ positions just as we can observe them from Earth. Bear this in mind in the following comparison.

The two below pairs of screenshots (from the SCOPE and NEAVE planetariums) compare the positions of Earth and Mars on two given dates separated by 546 days (ca. 1½ years). In this time interval, both Earth and Mars would have (**_according to the Copernican model_**) moved laterally by about 300 Mkm. Yet, on both of these dates, an earthly observer will see Mars perfectly aligned in conjunction with star Delta Capricorni. **How can this possibly occur in reality (as it does) if the Copernican model were true?**

In order to put this problem in due perspective, let's take a look at a classic explanation for the observed retrograde motion of Mars:

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/029_Retrograde_in_Copernican_universe.jpg)

Note that this particular parallax issue (the nearby Mars's parallax in relation to a given star) should not be confused with the historical - and still ongoing - controversy regarding stellar parallax (that is, the nigh-undetectable parallax between nearby and more distant stars, which we will explore later on). In the present case, we are dealing with the immensely more problematic **absence** of parallax between Mars and a given star - following a 1.5-year period (or about 546 days) during which, according to Copernican theory, Earth and Mars should both have displaced themselves 'sideways' by about 300 Million kilometers! Now, let this be clear:

**How Mars could possibly reconjunct with a given star after only 546 days whereas it normally / consistently does so (7 out of 8 times) in about 707 days, is a 'mystery' that the Copernican model cannot explain or justify in any rational manner.** 

On the other hand, the TYCHOS model provides a plain, simple and demonstrable explanation for this 'mysterious' behavior of Mars. I shall now guide you step by step through the 15-year period of Mars during which it realigns with a given star 7 times in 707 days and the 8th time around, in only 546 days. The below diagram shows how the odd 546-day period occurs: 

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/030_MARS_DeltaCapricorni_546days.jpg)

As you can see, the 546-day period occurs when Mars's orbital motion (which has it realigning with a given star every 707 days on 7 successive occasions)'closes' earlier, the 8th time around, due the 'asymmetrical' nature of Mars's 15-year spirographic pattern. It's just plain geometry - and nothing mysterious at all.

You will now rightfully ask: _Is Mars actually observed returning to the same celestial longitude for 7 successive 707-day periods - and the 8th time, in only 546 days? And does the TYCHOSIUM simulator confirm this peculiar behavior of Mars?"_   

Yes indeed: here's how the TYCHOSIUM simulator accounts for 8 transits of Mars at about 21h47m of RA (i.e. the celestial longitude of the star Deneb Algedi):

In stark contast, here's how the Copernican JS ORRERY simulator depicts these same 8 transits of Mars "as it conjuncts with the star Deneb Algedi":

You may wish to verify all of this for yourself by perusing the TYCHOSIUM 3D Planetarium. 



### The impossible (Copernican) 816-day re-conjunction of Earth and Venus with a given star

Next, we will compare two other screenshots from the SCOPE planetarium. They depict two conjunctions of Earth and Venus with star Regulus (in the Leo constellation) occurring within an interval of 816 days (or 2.234 years). In that time period, according to the Copernican model, Earth and Venus would both displace themselves laterally in space by about 200 million kilometers. Yet, an earthly observer will see Venus conjunct with star Regulus on both of these dates! How can the Copernican model possibly account for these empirical observations?

The NEAVE planetarium which simulates far more realistically what we can observe in our skies confirms that Venus and Regulus do indeed conjunct at both ends of our chosen 816-day period:

### How Venus returns facing the same star within 816 days — in the TYCHOS

Once again, the TYCHOS model can demonstrate how and why Venus will indeed return facing a given star in 816 days:

Before proceeding to expound the more technical aspects of the TYCHOS model (as well as the methods and logical processes behind its formulation) I have highlighted in the following chapters a number of intrinsically problematic aspects of the Copernican model that the TYCHOS does away with, corrects or effectively resolves.
