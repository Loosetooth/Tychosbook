Chapter 28 - The Barnard's star - in the TYCHOS
===========================================

Barnard's star is the fastest-moving star in our skies : as viewed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere, it is observed to briskly "ascend" in our skies, by as much as 10.36" (arcseconds) every year. It is also the next-closest star to Earth (after the Alpha Centauri binary system). As recently as November 2018, it was discovered that Barnard's star also has a companion and is therefore probably also a binary star system. It can be found 'due South' at midnight of the summer solstice (at 17h47m of RA) and lies fairly close to our equatorial ecliptic (at 04°41' of DECL). We shall now see how the observed motion of Barnard's star provides further support to the TYCHOS model's tenets.

An experienced amateur astronomer, [Dennis Di Cicco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_di_Cicco) is known for having most accurately monitored and photographed this rapidly-moving star for a full year or more (between 1994 and 1995/1996) and to have plotted this diagram of his observations:

Di Cicco's diagram shows how Barnard's star is observed to rise in our skies, "South-to-North" (and at a slight East-West angle). As you can see, this path exhibits an asymmetric curve (oscillating "from left-to-right") which I have highlighted in pink and blue. This curve has a distinct 4-month / 8-month frequency. 

The question is: what could possibly cause this 4-month / 8-month oscillation? Are we asked to believe that Barnard's star is somehow "zig-zagging" in space, all by itself, as it rises up in our skies - _at an exact 4-month / 8-month rate?_ Can the Copernican model explain this observed behavior of Barnard's star? Well, no.

Does the TYCHOS have any rational explanation for these bizarre, asymmetric East-West oscillating motions of Barnard's star? Well, yes.

Now, you may recall that 3:1 ratio of a "Man's Yearly Path" (as expounded in Chapter 21). In this case, however, we will be looking at a 2:1 ratio (i.e. 8 months versus 4 months). This, because the Barnard's star does not circle around us (unlike the Sun). Therefore, an earthly observer (revolving around his annual trochoidal path) who will, for a full year, patiently monitor a star located along the equatorial ecliptic (such as Barnard's star) will see it oscillating "East / West" at a 2:1 ratio (or at an 8-month / 4-month ratio). I know, dear readers: I do realize that this is a rather tricky matter for our human minds to process and visualize - but I hope that my below diagram will make it crystal clear :

**WHY BARNARD'S STAR "WOBBLES SIDEWAYS" AS OBSERVED**

 In reality, of course, the Barnard's star does not truly / physically zigzag in such manner as it travels across space. Its sideways oscillation is simply a consequence of the earthly observer's annual, trochoidal path. Our earthly frame of reference (vis-à-vis the stars) is constantly fluctuating back and forth along this "looping" path - and this goes to explain the many minuscule _"irregularities, perturbations, turbulences and aberrations"_ that astronomers, cosmologists and astrophysicists have been incessantly debating for the last few centuries. We may now stop conjecturing about any sort of "chaos theories" of our cosmos - and start enjoying its wonderful harmony and stability.
 
There really isn't much more to say about the observed motions of Barnard's star - but perhaps this final graphic on the subject will help you envision just how and why Dennis Di Cicco (who deserves a gigantic hat tip) recorded these peculiar motions of our next-to-nearmost star :
