Chapter 28 - The Barnard's star - in the TYCHOS
===========================================

Barnard's star is the fastest-moving star in our skies : as viewed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere, it is observed to briskly "ascend" in our skies, by as much as 10.36" (arcseconds) every year. It is also the next-closest star to Earth (after the Alpha Centauri binary system). As recently as November 2018, it was discovered that Barnard's star also has a companion and is therefore probably also a binary star system. It can be found 'due South' at midnight of the summer solstice (at 17h47m of RA) and lies fairly close to our equatorial ecliptic (at 04Â°41' of DECL). We shall now see how the observed motion of Barnard's star provides further support to the TYCHOS model's tenets.

An experienced amateur astronomer, [Dennis Di Cicco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_di_Cicco) is known for having most accurately monitored and photographed this rapidly-moving star for a full year (between 1994 and 1995) and to have plotted this diagram of his observations:

Di Cicco's diagram shows how Barnard's star is observed to rise in our skies. As you can see, this path exhibits an asymmetric curve (oscillating "from left-to-right") which I have highlighted in pink and blue. We see that this curve has a distinct 4-month / 8-month 'frequency.
