If you were to tell a child that practically all the stars we can see in the sky with our naked eyes have a binary companion, the child's reply would most likely be: _"So WHY doesn't the Sun also have a companion, dad? If mom didn't exist, I wouldn't exist either!"_ Your best answer would probably be: _"That's what astronomers say, honey - and they should know: they tell us that the Sun is a SINGLE star!"_ The child may then shed a tear at the sad thought that our Sun would be the loneliest star of our cosmic neighborhood. Incredulous, the enquiring child might then reply: "Dad! It doesn't make any sense! If ALL the stars around us have a partner, then our Sun must also have one!" You could then attempt to 'save face' by telling the child that you didn't say ALL of them - but '_practically_ all of them'.

However, as I shall expound in the present chapter, when considering the _most recent_ discoveries of observational astronomy, a reasonable case could certainly be made today that 100% of the stars in our skies are, in fact, 'double'(or multiple) binary stars; ergo, that ALL of the apparently single points of light in our skies (that we call 'stars') have a smaller companion - undetectable to the naked eye. The two of them revolve around each other in intersecting orbits - around their common barycenter - completing one such revolution in various time periods (ranging from just a few days, weeks, months or several years). In any case, what we know today is that the vast majority of our visible stars (90% and counting) are, in fact, binary systems.

It is important to know that Tycho Brahe - who died in 1601 - never knew about binary systems. The very first binary system (Mizar A and B) was discovered in 1650 by Giovanni Riccioli almost 50 years after Tycho’s death, and only following the invention of the telescope. However, it wasn’t until more than a century later that William Herschel formally announced his discovery of what he described as “binary sidereal systems”:

_“In 1797, Herschel measured many of the systems again, and discovered changes in their relative positions that could not be attributed to the parallax caused by the Earth's orbit. He waited until 1802 to announce the hypothesis that the two stars might be "binary sidereal systems" orbiting under mutual gravitational attraction, a hypothesis he confirmed in 1803 in his Account of the Changes that have happened, during the last Twenty-five Years, in the relative Situation of Double-stars; with an Investigation of the Cause to which they are owing. In all, Herschel discovered over 800 confirmed double or multiple star systems, almost all of them physical rather than optical pairs. His theoretical and observational work provided the foundation for modern binary star astronomy."_
— [_William Herschel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel)  
 
Here’s a chart of Herschel’s 805 certified double star systems. One can only wonder why Herschel's paradigm-shifting discoveries didn't trigger a revolution of sorts within astronomy - and why no one has, to this day, seriously reconsidered the tychonic model - what with its intersecting orbits of the Sun and Mars!

In any event, one cannot blame Tycho for failing to notice & identify (within his very own tychonic model) the obvious binary nature of the orbital interactions of  Mars and the Sun: in his time, no binary star systems had yet been discovered. He was thus unable - and understandably so - to reach the logical conclusion that the Sun and Mars must be a binary system - just like the vast majority (or probably ALL) of the stars in our skies. 

It was precisely this 'bizarre' feature of Brahe’s proposed model (the intersecting orbits of Mars and the Sun) that triggered the scoffing and derision of his peers: _“Sooner or later, the Sun and Mars must smash into each other!”_- they jeered. This was a typical example of how the regrettable group-think tendencies pervading this world's scientific community often resort to ridicule new ideas that challenge their consolidated beliefs. I would strongly recommend reading Howard Margolis’ impeccable demonstration that the mentally-perceived collision of the Sun and Mars (as of the tychonic model) always was an illusion – albeit one that befuddled the entire scientific community for a very long time. It makes for an exemplary case study of how even the sharpest human minds can be fooled for centuries on end by relatively simple, illusory “tricks” of geometry.

Let us now look at a classic binary star system, as illustrated on the below-linked webpage from the University of Oregon where we can read that the vast majority of the stars in the Milky Way are, in fact, binary stars resembling something like this basic configuration.

> “In fact, 85% of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy are not single stars, like the Sun, but multiple star systems, binaries or triplets.”

— [_Binary Stars_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/007B_Binary-Stars.htm) by Jim Schombert (2018) for University of Oregon Astronomy 122: Birth and Death of Stars

Today, the numbers of known binary star systems are in the range of several hundreds of thousands, as we can read in this Russian academic paper by Malkov, Karchevsky, Kaygorodov, Kovaleva and Skvortsov (October 2018):

“_**Binary Star Database (BDB): New Developments and Applications**.
The Identification List of Binaries (ILB) is a star catalogue constructed to facilitate crossreferencing between different catalogues of binary stars. [...] ILB currently contains about520,000 entries: 120,000 systems, 140,000 pairs and 260,000 components._”

Clearly, binary systems are certainly not a rarity, as previously believed. To be sure, almost 100% of our _nearmost_ stars have now been firmly established as being double (or multiple) binary systems. You may verify this by yourself by looking them up one by one in the Wikipedia.
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars 

As a matter of fact, the percentage of stars observed to be locked in binary systems has been steadily increasing in later years - thanks to advanced spectrometers and so-called Adaptive Optics (based on the Shack-Hartmann principle). The latter technological advancement has, in later years, spectacularly improved the ability to detect and reveal double-stars formerly believed to be single stars. Of course, the difficulty resides in the fact that they are often very close to each other and / or that the 'junior' companion can sometimes be extremely small (e.g. Sirius B, the tiny companion of Sirius A). The below two images illustrate just how a star (previously thought to be a single star) was shown to be in fact a double-star - thanks to the use of Adaptive Optics technology (in May 2013):

To wit, if it eventually emerges that 100% of the stars in our skies are double/binary systems, the current Copernican heliocentric theory (which holds that our Sun is a single/companionless star) would have to be definitively abandoned - beyond appeal - for being a most improbable "exception to the rule" or, if you will,  a one-of-a-kind cosmic anomaly! That is, unless we’d be willing to accept the truly astronomical odds of our nearest star (the Sun) being the one-and-only 'bachelor' in the entire universe — a most irrational and exceptionalistic notion, if there ever was one! In any case, the situation we have today is that virtually all of our nearmost stars are observed to have a binary companion - and more are being continuously discovered, with no end in sight. 

In the 1980s, one of the world’s top experts of binary star systems, Wulff Heintz, announced at the end of his illustrious career that at least 85% of all the stars in our skies must be double/binary stars, leaving us to wonder whether the remaining 15% would be “bachelor” stars (as our Sun is believed to be). Now, this announcement was made about 40 years ago; since then, thanks to technological advancements (e.g. Adaptive Optics - as described above), we have an incessant flow of new reports of binary companions revolving around larger host stars (formerly believed to be single stars). In later years we have all heard in the news media about new so-called “exoplanets” being discovered, almost on a weekly basis. Rarely though, if at all, do such announcements mention that some of these so-called “exoplanets” might be formerly unseen binary companions of larger stars. The reason for this may be due - in my humble opinion - to the growing realization that ALL the stars, without exception, may well be 'locked' in double/binary systems. This is of course a most inconvenient menace to the astronomy establishment - and may thus plausibly be kept under wraps. Obviously, there could be no more horrifying prospect for 'mainstream astronomers' (for lack of a better term) than having to admit that ALL the stars in our skies are, in fact, double stars revolving around their common center of mass, as this would spell the end of the Copernican / Keplerian heliocentric theory.

Critics of the Tychos model often object that it “violates Newton’s laws”. Well, Isaac Newton ― who died in 1726, i.e. many years before Herschel’s formal identification of “binary sidereal systems (in 1797) ― never had a chance to study them. I will therefore kindly ask my critics to acknowledge this simple fact - and to give me a gracious break about Newton's laws. We are now living in the 21st century - and to keep appealing to Isaac Newton's scientific authority is just silly - considering what we have learned in the last few centuries of astronomical discoveries. Having said that, I am sure that Sir Isaac was an exceptionally smart fellow, but none of his studies addressed the physics or celestial mechanics of binary star systems for the simple reason that, _in his time_, little or nothing was known about them. 

As for that other 'semi-God of science' Albert Einstein, here’s what Tom Van Flandern had to say about his theories - with regard to binary stars:

_“If the general relativity method is correct, it ought to apply everywhere, not just in the solar system. But Van Flandern points to a conflict outside it: binary stars with highly unequal masses. Their orbits behave in ways that the Einstein formula did not predict. ‘Physicists know about it and shrug their shoulders,’ Van Flandern says. They say there must be ‘something peculiar about these stars, such as an oblateness, or tidal effects.’ Another possibility is that Einstein saw
to it that he got the result needed to ‘explain’ Mercury’s orbit, but that it doesn’t apply elsewhere.”_
— [_Tom Van Flandern articles_](http://ldolphin.org/vanFlandern/)

In other words, Einstein's famed formulae FAILED to predict the orbital motions of binary stars. Now, **_that_** is a rather serious problem, if you ask me!


## About "Variable stars" & "Flare stars"

At the start of the 20th century, astronomers were debating whether so-called 'variable stars' (stars which change in brightness over regular time periods) were, quite simply, nothing but binary systems where the companion star periodically transited in front of its brighter binary partner, thus temporarily reducing its brightness. However, astronomers are still classifying many stars ― those not yet officially recognized as binary stars ― as “variable stars” or “flare stars”. So what exactly are these types of stars _meant_ to be? Let’s see what Wikipedia can tell us about them:

**Variable stars**(Wikipedia)
_"A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth (its apparent magnitude) fluctuates. This variation may be caused by a change in emitted light or by something partly blocking the light, so variable stars are classified as either:

_- Intrinsic variables, whose luminosity actually changes; for example, because the star periodically swells and shrinks.
_- Extrinsic variables, whose apparent changes in brightness are due to changes in the amount of their light that can reach Earth; for example, because the star has an orbiting companion that sometimes eclipses it.
Many, possibly most, stars have at least some variation in luminosity._”

I have to say that the first option (stars that periodically swell and shrink) sounds terribly outlandish to me! But let's get on:

**Flare stars** (Wikipedia)
_A flare star is a variable star that becomes very much brighter unpredictably for a few minutes at a time. Most flare stars are dim red dwarfs, although less massive (lighter) brown dwarfs might also be able to flare. The more massive (heavier) RS Canum Venaticorum variables (RS CVn) are also known to flare, but scientists understand that a companion star in a binary systemcauses these flares.”_

Thus, in both cases (variable and flare stars) we see that the best / most plausible explanation is that these stars are, quite simply, binary star systems whose brightness periodically dips due to one companion obscuring the other. There is no need to classify them as anything else but double/ binary stars. 

Here are a some relevant extracts from the book “Astronomy of to-day”, by Cecil G. Dolmage (1910):

_“It was at one time considered that a variable star was in all probability a body, a portion of whose surface had been relatively darkened in some manner akin to that in which sun spots mar the face of the sun; and that when its axial rotation brought the less illuminated portions in turn towards us, we witnessed a consequent diminution in the star's general brightness. [...] The scale on which it varies in brightness is very great, for it changes from the second to the ninth
magnitude. For the other leading type of variable star, Algol, of which mention has already been made, is the best instance. The shortness of the period in which the changes of brightness in such stars go their round, is the chief characteristic of this latter class. The period of Algol is a little under three days. This star when at its brightest is of about the second magnitude, and when least bright is reduced to below the third magnitude; from which it follows that its light, when at the minimum, is only about one-third of what it is when at the maximum. It seems definitely proved by means of the spectroscope that variables of this kind are merely binary stars, too close to be separated by the telescope, which, as a consequence of their orbits chancing to be edgewise towards us, eclipse each other in turn time after time.” [...] “Since the companion of Algol is often spoken of as a dark body, it were well here to point out that we have no evidence at all that it is entirely devoid of light. We have already found, in dealing with spectroscopic binaries, that when one of the component stars is below a certain magnitude its spectrum will not be seen; so one is left in the glorious uncertainty as to whether the body in question is absolutely dark, or darkish, or faint, or indeed only just out of range ofthe spectroscope."_

As it is, a little-known fact among lay people is that many so-called “stars” do not shine with their own light. For instance, red dwarfs (by far the most common type of “star” in our universe) can be so faint, dim and darkish as to be invisible/ undetectable by even our largest modern telescopes. In the Tychos model, of course, this would be the case of Mars (the Sun’s binary companion) which exhibits the characteristic orange hue associated with red dwarfs. Now, Mars is only about 0.5% the size of the Sun, and Sirius B (the tiny companion of the brightest star in our skies, Sirius A) also happens to be about 0.5% the size of its far larger partner. In fact, Alvan Clark’s discovery in 1862 of the tiny Sirius B caused a stir among the 19th century's science community, since it was totally unexpected under Newton’s gravitational theories that such a small body (Sirius B is reckoned to be slightly smaller than Earth) could possibly be gravitationally bound to such a huge body as Sirius A. Incredibly enough, this major and pesky riddle was eventually 'resolved' - or rather, explained away - by our world’s top astrophysicists as follows: they simply concluded (in spite of the lack of any conceivable experimental verification - and in what must be one of the crudest instances of ad hoc / confirmation-bias-tainted postulation in science history) that the mass/ or density/ or gravitational attraction (call it what you will) of Sirius B has to be about “400,000 times larger than that of Earth”! That's right, modern astronomers and astrophysicists contend that Sirius B is slightly smaller than Earth (in diameter), but that its atoms are somehow packed 400 THOUSAND TIMES tighter than the atoms are on our planet! Ironically enough, Isaac Newton (their sacrosanct science-God) became famous for demonstrating that the laws of physics observable on Earth are the same as those ruling the physics of our entire universe! Go figure...    


**EXTREMELY RECENT DISCOVERIES OF 'NEW' BINARY STAR SYSTEMS**

As recently as the year 2016, it was announced that a binary companion of _**our very NEARMOST star**_, Proxima Centauri, had been discovered! This newly detected body is now called “Proxima B”. This stunning and very recent realization (that even the _closest_ stellar object in our skies is a double-star) goes to show just how difficult it is, even for our most advanced 21st century instruments, to detect a binary companion to any given star. 

Then, in 2018, it was announced that a companion of _**our second-NEARMOST star**_, Barnard’s star, had been discovered! As it happens, the existence of Barnard’s star binary companion was the object of a bitter controversy between Peter Van de Kamp and Wulff Heintz back in the 1980s. Van de Kamp was convinced he had seen the now confirmed Barnard’s star companion, but Wulff Heintz would have nothing of it. For years, vigorous efforts were deployed to discredit Van de Kamp’s discovery, claiming it was an artifact created by the improper cleaning of his telescope lenses (!). Yet, as we shall see, Van de Kamp’s observational work has now finally been vindicated. 

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/VanDeKamp_WulffHeinz_01.jpg) 

This epic controversy between these two eminent astronomers (and binary-star experts) really deserves to be recounted, so here we go: it all had to do with Van de Kamp’s strong conviction, matured over decades of observational studies, that even Barnard’s star had a binary companion. Our second-nearmost star, the Barnard’s star, is famed for being the fastest-moving star in our skies (yet, in a human lifetime, it will only move by about the angular diameter of our Moon, i.e. approximately 0.5°). Here follows an extract from the Wikipedia which briefly summarizes the bitter Van de Kamp / Wulff Heintz dispute:  

“_**Barnard’s Star affair**
In the spring of 1937, Van de Kamp left McCormick Observatory to take over as director of Swarthmore College’s Sproul Observatory. There he made astrometric measurements of Barnard’s Star and in the 1960s reported a periodic “wobble” in its motion, apparently due to planetary companions. [...] Astronomer John L. Hershey found that this anomaly apparently occurred after each time the objective lens was removed, cleaned, and replaced. Hundreds more stars showed “wobbles” like Barnard’s Star’s when photographs before and after cleaning were compared — a virtual impossibility. Wulff Heintz, Van de Kamp’s successor at Swarthmore and
an expert on double stars, questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards; the two are reported to have become estranged because of this. Van de Kamp never admitted that his claim was in error and continued to publish papers about a planetary system around Barnard’s Star into the 1980s, while modern radial velocity curves place a limit on the planets much smaller than claimed by Van de Kamp. **Recent evidence suggests that there is, indeed, a planet orbiting Barnard’s Star, albeit of much lower mass than Van de Kamp could have detected._”**

Indeed, it now turns out that Heintz was wrong and that Van de Kamp was right, all along! In November 2018, the ground-based European Observatory announced:

“_Super-Earth Orbiting Barnard’s Star Red Dots campaign uncovers compelling evidence of exoplanet around closest single star to Sun. A planet has been detected orbiting Barnard’s Star, a mere 6 light-years away. This breakthrough - announced in a paper published today in the journal Nature - is a result of the
Red Dots and CARMENES projects, whose search for local rocky planets has already uncovered a new world orbiting our nearest neighbour, Proxima Centauri.
The planet, designated Barnard’s Star b, now steps in as the second-closest known exoplanet to Earth. The gathered data indicate that the planet could be a super-Earth, having a mass at least 3.2 times that of the Earth, which orbits its host star in roughly 233 days. Barnard’s Star, the planet’s host star, is a red dwarf, a cool, low-mass star, which only dimly illuminates this newly-discovered world._”
https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1837/ 

It is interesting to note that both ESA (in 2007) and NASA (in 2010) decided to discontinue their efforts to search for Barnard’s companion due to... “lack of funding”! Here’s what we may read on Wikipedia about this curious circumstance: 

“_Null results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including interferometric work with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999. Gatewood was able to show in 1995 that planets with 10 MJ were impossible around Barnard's Star in a paper which helped refine the negative certainty regarding planetary objects in general. In 1999, the Hubble work further excluded planetary companions of 0.8 MJ with an orbital period of less than 1,000 days (Jupiter's orbital period is 4,332 days), while Kuerster determined in 2003 that within the habitable zone around Barnard's Star, planets are not possible with an "M sin i" value greater than 7.5 times the mass of the Earth (M🜨), or with a mass greater than 3.1 times the mass of Neptune (much lower than van de Kamp's smallest suggested value). (...) Even though this research greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard’s Star, it did not rule them out completely as terrestrial planets were always going to be difficult to detect. NASA’s Space Interferometry Mission, which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, was reported to have chosen Barnard’s Star as an early search target. **This mission was shut down in 2010. ESA’s similar Darwin interferometry mission had the same goal, but was stripped of funding in 2007.**_
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star 

So there you have it: both NASA’s and ESA’s efforts to search for Barnard’s companion were shut down. One may legitimately wonder why. Lack of funding? Really? Or perhaps NASA and ESA are unwilling — for some reason — to help establish that all the stars in our skies are in fact binary/double-star systems? Of course, we may only conjecture about the motives for our world's largest space agencies to _abandon_ the search of the Barnard star's binary companion. However, one fact remains - which cannot be denied: Van der Kamp's humble observational work succeeded where NASA's efforts had failed - in spite of their touted "Hubble Space Telescope" and immensely superior technological resources!      


**MORE LINKS TO BINARY STAR LITERATURE**

Here’s a selection of quotes about binary stars from various astronomy sources:

> “There are many common misconceptions about binary star systems, one of the most common myths is that binary star systems are the cosmic oddity and that single star systems are the most prevalent, when, in fact, the opposite is true. 50 years ago binary stars were considered a rarity. Now, most of the stars in our galaxy are known to be paired with a companion or multiple partners.”

— [_Binary Star Prevalence_](https://www.tychos.info/citation/008A_BRI-evidence.htm) from BRI

> “Binary stars are two stars orbiting a common center of mass. **More than four-fifths (80%)** of the single points of light we observe in the night sky are actually two or more stars orbiting together. The most common of the multiple star systems are binary stars, systems of only two stars together. These pairs come in an array of configurations that help scientists to classify stars, and could have impacts on the development of life. Some people even think that the sun is part of a binary system.”

— _[Binary Star Systems: Classification and Evolution](https://www.tychos.info/citation/008B_Space-Binary-Star-Systems.htm)_ by SPACE.com Staff (January 17, 2018)

> “Binary stars are of immense importance to astronomers as they allow the masses of stars to be determined. A binary system is simply one in which two stars orbit around a common centre of mass, that is they are gravitationally bound to each other. Actually most stars are in binary systems. Perhaps up to 85% of stars are in binary systems with some in triple or even higher-multiple systems.”

— _[Binary Stars](https://www.tychos.info/citation/008C_ATNF-Binary-Stars.htm)_ by CSIRO Australia Telescope National Facility (2017)

Would you be surprised to know that the idea that the Sun is part of a binary system is not a new concept? The Binary Research Institute headed by Walter Cruttenden has been looking into this hypothesis for many years. Unfortunately, their reasoning-process is stuck in the Copernican heliocentric paradigm, and thus, their ongoing search for the Sun’s elusive binary companion has never considered Mars as a possible candidate. Their current, favored candidate (for a binary companion of the Sun) appears to be Sirius. Sirius, however, is itself a binary system (Sirius A and B revolve around their common barycenter every 50.1 years). Nonetheless, Cruttenden (et al) have made a great job demonstrating, in methodical fashion, that the so-called “Lunisolar” theory (_i.e.;_ Earth’s purported “wobble” around its axis) is utterly untenable. But more about this later.

_[Understanding Precession of the Equinox](https://www.tychos.info/citation/009A_Understanding-Precession.pdf)_ by Walter Cruttenden and Vince Dayes (2003)

The below spirographic (or trochoidal) patterns are from a fairly recent study (2010) concerned with the “barycentric motion of exoplanet host stars”. In the TYCHOS model — as we shall see — the paths of Mars, Venus and Mercury all bear some resemblance to these complex & beautiful orbital patterns that modern astronomers are observing nowadays in binary star systems.

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/007_StarTrajectories_01.jpg)

Above — from p. 6 of _[The barycentric motion of exoplanet host stars](https://www.tychos.info/citation/009B_Barycentric-Motion.pdf)_ by M. A. C. Perryman and T. Schulze-Hartung (2010)

Indeed, one may justly wonder why our very own Solar System would **not** feature orbital patterns (or 'barycentric oscillations') similar to those depicted by the above study. Why would celestial bodies in other systems observed from Earth trace such charming, spirographic paths — as opposed to the dull & orderly (yet 'slighlty elliptical') orbits of our own Solar System's planets and moons - as proposed by the Copernican / Keplerian model? Are we earthlings just… out of luck?

In the light of the information and considerations expounded in this chapter, I trust that the notion of the Sun and Mars being a binary pair may be welcomed as a sound and intellectually-acceptable proposition.
