Chapter 18: Uranus, Neptune & Pluto prove the PVP orbit
=====================================================

Acoording to the official tables, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto orbit around us in a trifle less than 84, 165 and 248 years respectively. This fact alone is, you may admit, rather curious - for why would each of these three bodies exhibit orbital periods that fall _just short_ of an integer number of years? Surely, if Earth were also revolving around the Sun (at its own hypersonic speed), this would constitute a most extraordinary coincidence?  

 _"URANUS: “Orbital period: 30589 days — or about 83.74 years"_ (or a trifle less than **84** years)

_"NEPTUNE: “Orbital Period: 60182 days — or about 164.77 years"_ (or a trifle less than **165** years)

_"PLUTO: “Orbital Period: 90560 days — or about 247.94 years"_ (or a trifle less than **248** years)

In the TYCHOS however, their true orbital periods can be shown to be precisely 84, 165 and 248 years respectively. The only reason why they will _appear_ to be a trifle shorter (to an earthly observer) is due to the Earth's motion around its PVP orbit, thus causing a parallax effect (vis-à-vis the starry background) from one period to the next. What follows will demonstrate that these parallax effects neatly reflect - and are commensurate with - the Earth's motion around its 25344-year PVP orbit.  


## URANUS — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period of Uranus: exactly 84 Solar Years, or 30681 days (or _exactly_ 1050 X **29.22 days** - our Moon's TMSP).

In 84 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 84 ≈ 1 179 024 km (i.e. 0.3314% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 84 years is 0.3314% of the TGY (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 years).

Now, 0.3314% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 4.77 min of RA.

And in fact, every 84 years Uranus appears to "drift against the stars" by approximately 4.7 min of RA (on average). Hence, we may infer that this drift is illusory - and is just a parallax effect caused by Earth's motion over an 84-year period. 

Example: between the date 1910-10-08 and 1994-10-08 (an 84-year period) Uranus moved from 19h30min of RA to 19h34.7min of RA:

In other words, Uranus' true orbital period is precisely 84 years - and not 83.74 years (as officially reckoned), as this discrepancy disappears when taking into account the Earth's motion around its PVP orbit.

## NEPTUNE — in the TYCHOS:


Orbital period of Neptune: exactly 165 Solar Years, or 60266.25 days (or _exactly**_ 2062.5 x **29.22 days** - our Moon's TMSP).

In 165 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 165 ≈ 2 315 940 km (0.651% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 165 years is 0.651% of the TGY (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 years).

Now, 0.651% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 9.4 min of RA.

And in fact, every 165 years Neptune appears to "drift against the stars" by approximately 10 min of RA (on average). Hence, we may infer that this drift is illusory - and is just a parallax effect caused by Earth's motion over a 165-year period.  

Example: between the date 1861-06-10 and 2026-06-10 (a 165-year period), Neptune will have moved from 0h07min of RA to 0h17min of RA:

In other words, Neptune's true orbital period is precisely 165 years - and not 164.77 years (as officially reckoned), as this discrepancy disappears when taking into account the Earth's motion around its PVP orbit. 

## PLUTO — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period of Pluto: exactly 248 Solar Years, or 90582 days (or _exactly**_ 3100 x **29.22 days** - our Moon's TMSP).

In 248 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 165 ≈ 3 480 928 km (0.978% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 248 years is 0.978% of the TGY (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 years).

Now, 0.978% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 14 min of RA.

And in fact, every 248 years Pluto appears to "drift against the stars" by approximately 13(+/-1) min of RA. Hence, we may infer that this drift is illusory - and is just a parallax effect caused by Earth's motion over a 248-year period. In other words, Pluto's true orbital period is precisely 248 years - and not 247.94 years (as officially reckoned), as this discrepancy disappears when taking into account the Earth's motion around its PVP orbit.  

Example: between the date 1941-10-28 and 2189-10-28 (a 248-year period), Pluto will have moved from 8h37.1min of RA to 8h49.6min of RA:

The above conceptual diagram should clarify what is meant by "drift against the stars" - and what it implies: if our JOE is a Copernican astronomer, he will obviously not be aware of his own 248-year displacement around the PVP orbit. Hence, he will estimate Pluto's orbital period to be slightly shorter than 248 years - since Pluto will align with his chosen reference star slightly earlier (i.e., in 247.94 years) than a full 248 years.  


In conclusion, the true values of the orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are (just like all the other bodies in our Solar System) exact integer multiples of the TMSP (our Moon's True Mean Synodic Period of 29.22 days) and, of course of our solar year. All of their apparent (and seemingly fluctuating - over long time spans) longitudinal drifts vis-à-vis to the stars are parallax effects attributable to Earth’s 1.6km/h motion around its PVP orbit. 

Our Solar System is a marvellous and stunningly stable 'clockwork' in which the orbital periods of all its components are exact, integer multiples of those of our Moon - and of our Sun. Unfortunately, to this day, our world's astronomers have persistently failed to realize this beautiful regularity of its orbital motions. Whenever they have encountered what they deemed to be anomalous variations or irregularites, they have attributed these to imaginary "perturbations" (either "gravitational" or "non-gravitational"), assorted "turbulences" and "trepidations" - or even to random, "chaotic behaviors"! Entire lifetimes have been spent in intricate calculations and abstruse "numerical integrations" in the quest of making sense of our (seemingly irregular) cosmic motions. In light of this, the TYCHOS model should come as a welcome relief to the world's astronomers and astrophysicists, were it only for saving them untold amounts time and efforts in complex, decimal-ridden computations.
