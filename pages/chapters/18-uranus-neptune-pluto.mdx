Chapter 18: Uranus & Neptune attest the Tychos Great Year 
=====================================================

Officially, Uranus and Neptune orbit around our system in a little less than 84 and 165 years respectively. 

> _"URANUS: “Orbital period: 30589 days — about 83.74 years"_ (or a trifle less than **84** years)

_"NEPTUNE: “Orbital Period: 60182 days.” — about 164.77 years"_ (or a trifle less than **165** years)

In the TYCHOS however, their true orbital periods can be shown to be precisely 84 and 165 years respectively. The only reason why they will _appear_ to be a trifle shorter (to an earthly observer) is due to the Earth's motion around its PVP orbit, thus causing a slight parallax effect (vis-à-vis the starry background) from one 84-year-period or 165-year-period to the next. What follows will demonstrate that these parallax effects actually reflect - and are commensurate with - the Earth's motion around its 25344-year PVP orbit.  


## Uranus — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period of Uranus: exactly 84 Solar Years, or 30681 days (or _exactly_ 1050 X 29.22 days - our Moon's TMSP).

In 84 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 84 ≈ 1 179 024 km (i.e. 0.3314% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 84 years is 0.3314% of 25344 years (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year).

Now, 0.3314% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 4.77 min of RA.

And in fact, every 84 years Uranus 'processes eastwards' against the stars by approximately 4.7 min of RA (on average).

Example: between the date 1910-10-08 and 1994-10-08 (an 84-year period) Uranus moved from 19h30min of RA to 19h34.7min of RA:

We may thus reasonably interpret this observed displacement of Uranus as being a consequence of Earth's slow motion around its PVP orbit. 


## Neptune — in the TYCHOS:


Orbital period of Neptune: exactly 165 Solar Years, or 60266.25 days (or _exactly**_ 2062.5 x 29.22 days - our Moon's TMSP).

In 165 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 165 ≈ 2 315 940 km (0.651% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 165 years is 0.651% of 25344 years (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year).

Now, 0.651% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 9.4 min of RA.

And in fact, every 165 years Neptune 'processes eastwards' against the stars by approximately 10 min of RA (on average). 

Example: between the date 1861-06-10 and 2026-06-10 (a 165-year period), Neptune moved from 0h07min of RA to 0h17min of RA:

We may thus reasonably interpret this observed displacement of Neptune as being a consequence of Earth's slow motion around its PVP orbit. 




In conclusion, the true values of the orbital periods of these planets are - in actuality - integer multiples of the TMSP (our Moon's True Mean Synodic Period). All of their apparent precessional drifts relatively to the stars are parallax effects directly caused by Earth’s 1.6km/h motion around its PVP orbit.
