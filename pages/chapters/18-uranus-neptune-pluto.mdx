Chapter 18: Uranus, Neptune & Pluto prove the PVP orbit
=====================================================

As of official tables, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto orbit around Earth in a trifle less than 84, 165 and 248 years respectively. This fact alone is, you may admit, rather curious - for why would all three of these bodies exhibit orbital periods that fall _just short_ of an integer number of years?  

> _"URANUS: “Orbital period: 30589 days — about 83.74 years"_ (or a trifle less than **84** years)

_"NEPTUNE: “Orbital Period: 60182 days.” — about 164.77 years"_ (or a trifle less than **165** years)

_"PLUTO: “Orbital Period: 90560 days.” — about 247.94 years_ (or a trifle less than **248** years)

In the TYCHOS however, their true orbital periods can be shown to be precisely 84, 165 and 248 years respectively. The only reason why they will _appear_ to be a trifle shorter (to an earthly observer) is due to the Earth's motion around its PVP orbit, thus causing a slight parallax effect (vis-à-vis the starry background) from one period to the next. What follows will demonstrate that these parallax effects neatly reflect - and are commensurate with - the Earth's motion around its 25344-year PVP orbit.  


## URANUS — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period of Uranus: exactly 84 Solar Years, or 30681 days (or _exactly_ 1050 X **29.22 days** - our Moon's TMSP).

In 84 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 84 ≈ 1 179 024 km (i.e. 0.3314% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 84 years is 0.3314% of the TGY (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 years).

Now, 0.3314% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 4.77 min of RA.

And in fact, every 84 years Uranus appears to "drift against the stars" by approximately 4.7 min of RA (on average).

Example: between the date 1910-10-08 and 1994-10-08 (an 84-year period) Uranus moved from 19h30min of RA to 19h34.7min of RA:

We may thus reasonably interpret this longitudinal displacement of Uranus as a direct consequence of Earth's motion around its PVP orbit. Uranus' true orbital period is precisely 84 years - and not 83.74 years (as officially reckoned), this discrepancy being caused by an illusory parallax effect. 


## NEPTUNE — in the TYCHOS:


Orbital period of Neptune: exactly 165 Solar Years, or 60266.25 days (or _exactly**_ 2062.5 x **29.22 days** - our Moon's TMSP).

In 165 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 165 ≈ 2 315 940 km (0.651% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 165 years is 0.651% of the TGY (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 years).

Now, 0.651% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 9.4 min of RA.

And in fact, every 165 years Neptune appears to "drift against the stars" by approximately 10 min of RA (on average). 

Example: between the date 1861-06-10 and 2026-06-10 (a 165-year period), Neptune will have moved from 0h07min of RA to 0h17min of RA:

We may thus reasonably interpret this longitudinal displacement of Neptune as a direct consequence of Earth's motion around its PVP orbit. Neptune's true orbital period is precisely 165 years - and not 164.77 years (as officially reckoned), this discrepancy being caused by an illusory parallax effect. 

## PLUTO — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period of Pluto: exactly 248 Solar Years, or 90582 days (or _exactly**_ 3100 x **29.22 days** - our Moon's TMSP).

In 248 years, Earth moves by 14036 km X 165 ≈ 3 480 928 km (0.978% of the PVP orbit's circumference of 355 724 597 km).

This means of course that 248 years is 0.978% of the TGY (i.e. the TYCHOS Great Year of 25344 years).

Now, 0.978% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min ≈ 14 min of RA.

And in fact, every 248 years Pluto appears to "drift against the stars" by approximately 13(+/-1) min of RA.

Example: between the date 1941-10-28 and 2189-10-28 (a 248-year period), Pluto will have moved from 8h37.1min of RA to 8h49.6 min of RA:

The above diagram should clarify what is meant by "drift against the stars" - and what it implies: if our JOE is a Copernican astronomer, he will obviously not be aware of his own 248-year displacement around the PVP orbit. Hence, he will estimate Pluto's orbital period to be slightly shorter than 248 years - since Pluto will align with his chosen reference star a while earlier (i.e., in 247.94 years) than a full 248 years.  


In conclusion, the true values of the orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are (just like all the other bodies in our Solar System) integer multiples of the TMSP (our Moon's True Mean Synodic Period of 29.22 days). All of their apparent precessional / longitudinal drifts relatively to the stars are parallax effects attributable to Earth’s 1.6km/h motion around its PVP orbit.
