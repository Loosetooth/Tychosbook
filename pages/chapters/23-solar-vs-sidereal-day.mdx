Chapter 23 - Are the stars much closer than believed?
===========================================

The most indigestible aspect of the heliocentric theory is, undoubtedly, its implications for the extravagant sizes and remoteness of the stars.

Ever since the Copernican theory came along, the apparent angular diameter of the stars as perceived from Earth by the human eye has been one of the most hotly debated issues of astronomy. Since the theory implied that the stars were hugely more distant than previously believed, it became imperative for the Copernican advocates to find some justification for the apparent size of the distant stars. This, because the stars in our skies (especially the largest or closest “first-magnitude stars”) appear to our naked eye to be far too large, if they were to be as formidably distant as currently claimed.

Let me use a real photograph of our night skies to illustrate the issue at hand. Note how the apparent diameter of the star Sirius seems to be roughly the same size, or even a tad bigger, than that of the planet Jupiter, as viewed from Earth by a naked-eye observer:

That’s right: if we were to trust our own eyes (something we may all probably need to learn anew!), we would have to conclude that Sirius is about 8834 times larger than the Sun. That is, of course, assuming that Sirius is truly as distant as currently claimed - i.e., 8.6 light years (or 543,865 times further away than the Sun). Yes, that's more than HALF A MILLION times more distant than our Sun - a point of light that subtends only about 0.5° in our sky!

Our Moon also subtends about 0.5° in our sky. Now, take a good look at the above photograph - and compare the visible sizes of the Moon and Sirius. Does Sirius appear to be several million times smaller than the Moon - the apparent size of which is similar to our Sun? Of course not. 

Moreover, we would have to accept that _most_ of our visible stars are many thousands of times larger than our own star. As it is, this is precisely what Tycho Brahe held as the most unacceptable notion put forth by the Copernicans: the sheer absurdity of the gigantic star sizes and distances their novel model implied. Over the last centuries, volumes of science literature have sought to explain the apparent optical aberration of the observed star sizes. Ironically, it was that epochal technological advancement - the telescope - that provided the Copernicans with some "optical justification” (or, if you will, another 'aberration of light') for the pesky problem, courtesy of the British Astronomer Royal George Airy (yes, the same guy who disproved James Bradley's "aberration of starlight"!...)

Today, young astronomers are taught that the observed dimensions of the points of light emanating from the stars are totally spurious because they are artificially enlarged as they traverse Earth’s atmosphere. In telescopes, a phenomenon known as 'diffraction' would cause the angular diameter of the stars to appear much, much larger than they are in reality. Here’s a quote from Wikipedia describing “the Airy disk”:

> _**"AIRY DISK** : The resolution of optical devices is limited by diffraction. So even the most perfect lens can’t quite generate a point image at its focus, but instead there is a bright central pattern now called the Airy disk, surrounded by concentric rings comprising an Airy pattern. The size of the Airy disk depends on the light wavelength and the size of the aperture. John Herschel had previously described the phenomenon, but Airy was the first to explain it theoretically. This was a key argument in refuting one of the last remaining arguments for absolute geocentrism: the giant star argument. Tycho Brahe and Giovanni Battista Riccioli pointed out that the lack of stellar parallax detectable at the time entailed that stars were a huge distance away. But the naked eye and the early telescopes with small apertures seemed to show that stars were disks of a certain size. This would imply that the stars were many times larger than our sun (they were not aware
of supergiant or hypergiant stars, but some were calculated to be even larger than the size of the whole universe estimated at the time). However, the disk appearances of the stars were spurious: they were not actually seeing stellar images, but Airy disks. With modern telescopes, even with those having the largest magnification, the images of almost all stars correctly appear as mere points of light.”_

In short, Airy claimed that we cannot trust our eyes when it comes to judging the angular diameters of the stars, since points of light are distorted / enlarged as they traverse Earth’s atmosphere. However, there’s an obvious problem with Airy’s theory: why wouldn’t the points of light emanating from our planets (e.g. Jupiter) be similarly affected? Doesn’t the light coming from our planets also traverse our atmosphere much as that emitted by the stars? Of course it does. Tycho Brahe’s estimate of the angular diameter of Vega (a so-called “first-magnitude star”) was 120 arcseconds, or only about 16 times smaller than the angular diameter subtended by the Sun (1920 arcseconds). Now, many of you will probably scoff at Brahe's “generous” estimate of the size of Vega, yet here’s a comparative graphic I made to illustrate what this would look like:

![](http://septclues.com/TYCHOS/Sun_versus_1stmagStar_01.jpg)

Big dot = the Sun. Small dot = a 1st magnitude star such as Vega, visually 16 times smaller than the Sun, according to Tycho Brahe.

The small dot is only 16 times smaller than the big dot (representing the Sun). All in all, it doesn’t look too different from what we can see in reality with our own eyes, does it? Now consider this: Vega (the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus) is currently believed to be 25 light years away, i.e. 1,583,000 times (yes, more than 1.5 million times!) further away than our Sun. Yet, Vega’s diameter is estimated to be only about 2.3 times
larger than that of the Sun. Now, if I enlarged the big dot in my above comparative graphic 2.3 times, then scaled it down **1.5 million times**, would it possibly be visible from Earth with any sort of telescope? I trust that you will realize the absurdity of it all - but it gets worse.

### How can we see so many stars with our NAKED EYES?

1 AU (average Earth-Sun distance) = 149,597,870.7 km (or roughly 149.6 Mkm)

1 Light Year = 9,460,730,472,580.8 km (or roughly 63241 AU !) 

It is a matter of historical record that Tycho Brahe rejected the idea of the implied, Copernican star sizes and distances. This conviction may be phrased in a question such as, _“why would Alpha Centauri (believed to be our nearmost star) be so enormously more distant than, say, Saturn?”_ To be sure, this still-unanswered question was precisely what most bothered Tycho Brahe about the heliocentric Copernican theory.

> _“In the absence of any observed stellar parallax, Tycho scoffed for example at the absurdity of the distance and the sizes of the fixed stars that the Copernican system required: Then the stars of the third magnitude which are one minute in diameter will necessarily be equal to the entire annual orb \[of the earth\], that is, they would comprise in their diameter 2284 semidiameters of the earth. They will be distant by about 7850000 of the same semidiameters. What will we say of the stars of first magnitude, of which some reach two, some almost three minutes of visible diameter? And what if, in addition, the eighth sphere were removed higher, so that the annual motion of the earth vanished entirely \[and was no longer perceptible\] from there? Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption \[of the motion of the earth\] by inference.”_

Here is the inescapable question our world's astronomers should be confronted with: _how can so many stars possibly be visible to our unaided eyes?_

If we consider the distances currently claimed for one of our brighter stars, Deneb (_a.k.a._ Alpha Cygni), the whole affair becomes well and truly outlandish. Deneb is said to be a good 200 times larger than our Sun - but we are also told that it is a whopping 2600 LY away from our eyes - or about **164,426,800 AU!**

Well, that's over 164 MILLION times further away than the Sun (!!!) - or if you prefer, **24,598,249,280,000,000 km**

**Yet, Deneb is one of the _brightest_ “naked-eye stars” in our skies!**

> _“A blue-white supergiant, Deneb is also one of the most luminous stars. However, its exact distance (and hence luminosity) has been difficult to calculate; it is estimated to be somewhere between 55,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the Sun.”_

— from Wikipedia entry on [“Deneb”](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Deneb.pdf)

_"Between 55,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the Sun"?..._ With such a vast range of brightness (or luminosity) estimates, one may suspect that these estimates are no more than wild guesses. Besides, could these formidable luminosity estimates just be a way of "justifying" the immense stellar distances that the Copernican model requires? The above Wikipedia page for star Deneb goes on to say that,

> _“One 2008 calculation using the Hipparcos data \[gathered by ESA’s Hipparcos satellite\] puts the most likely distance at 1550 light-years, with an uncertainty of only around 10%.”_

Yet, some modern planetariums have Deneb at a distance of 3227 light years, _i.e.;_ over twice as distant! Do the stellar distance estimations of our world’s astronomers _ever_ agree with each other? Is star Deneb 1550, or 2600 — or 3227 light years away? Evidently, no one seems to know with any degree of precision. I, for one, grew up with the notion that astronomy was far more exacting than this. Yet, today we constantly hear about the _"extraordinary accuracy of modern astronomy instruments"._ As I see it, the only extraordinary thing is the shameless arrogance pervading the 'academic' spheres of our world's scientific community.
