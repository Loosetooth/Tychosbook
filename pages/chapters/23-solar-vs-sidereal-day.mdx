Chapter 23 - Are the stars much closer than believed?
===========================================

Ever since the Copernican theory came along, the apparent angular diameter of the stars as perceived from Earth by the human eye has been one of the most hotly debated issues of astronomy. Since the theory implied that the stars were hugely more distant than previously believed, it became imperative for the Copernican advocates to find some justification for the apparent size of the distant stars. This, because the stars in our skies (especially the largest or closest “first-magnitude stars”) appear to our naked eye to be far too large, if they were to be as formidably distant as currently claimed.

Let me use a real photograph of our night skies to illustrate the issue at hand. Note how the apparent diameter of the star Sirius seems to be roughly the same size, or even a tad bigger, than that of the planet Jupiter, as viewed from Earth by a naked-eye observer:

That’s right: if we were to trust our own eyes (something we may all probably need to learn anew!), we would have to conclude that Sirius is about 8834 times larger than the Sun. That is, of course, assuming that Sirius is truly as distant as currently claimed - i.e., 8.6 light years (or 543,865 times further away than the Sun). Yes, that's more than HALF A MILLION times more distant than our Sun - a point of light that subtends only about 0.5° in our sky!

Our Moon also subtends about 0.5° in our sky. Now, take a good look at the above photograph - and compare the visible sizes of the Moon and Sirius. Does Sirius appear to be several million times smaller than the Moon - the apparent size of which is similar to our Sun? Of course not. 

Moreover, we would have to accept that _most_ of our visible stars are many thousands of times larger than our own star. As it is, this is precisely what Tycho Brahe held as the most unacceptable notion put forth by the Copernicans: the sheer absurdity of the gigantic star sizes and distances their novel model implied. Over the last centuries, volumes of science literature have sought to explain the apparent optical aberration of the observed star sizes. Ironically, it was that epochal technological advancement - the telescope - that ultimately provided the Copernicans with some "scientific justification” for the pesky problem, courtesy of the British Astronomer Royal George Airy (yes, the same guy who disproved James Bradley's "aberration of starlight"!...)

Today, young astronomers are taught that the observed dimensions of the points of light emanating from the stars are totally spurious because they are artificially enlarged as they traverse Earth’s atmosphere. In telescopes, a phenomenon known as 'diffraction' would cause the angular diameter of the stars to appear much larger than they are in reality. Here’s a quote from Wikipedia describing “the Airy disk”:

> _**"AIRY DISK** : The resolution of optical devices is limited by diffraction. So even the most perfect lens can’t quite generate a point image at its focus, but instead there is a bright central pattern now called the Airy disk, surrounded by concentric rings comprising an Airy pattern. The size of the Airy disk depends on the light wavelength and the size of the aperture. John Herschel had previously described the phenomenon, but Airy was the first to explain it theoretically. This was a key argument in refuting one of the last remaining arguments for absolute geocentrism: the giant star argument. Tycho Brahe and Giovanni Battista Riccioli pointed out that the lack of stellar parallax detectable at the time entailed that stars were a huge distance away. But the naked eye and the early telescopes with small apertures seemed to show that stars were disks of a certain size. This would imply that the stars were many times larger than our sun (they were not aware
of supergiant or hypergiant stars, but some were calculated to be even larger than the size of the whole universe estimated at the time). However, the disk appearances of the stars were spurious: they were not actually seeing stellar images, but Airy disks. With modern telescopes, even with those having the largest magnification, the images of almost all stars correctly appear as mere points of light.”_

In short, Airy claimed that we cannot trust our eyes when it comes to judging the angular diameters of the stars, since points of light are distorted / enlarged as they traverse Earth’s atmosphere. However, there’s an obvious problem with Airy’s theory: why wouldn’t the points of light emanating from our planets (e.g. Jupiter) be similarly affected? Doesn’t the light coming from our planets also traverse our atmosphere much as that emitted by the stars? Of course it does. Tycho Brahe’s estimate of the angular diameter of Vega (a so-called “first-magnitude star”) was 120 arcseconds, or only about 16 times smaller than the angular diameter subtended by the Sun (1920 arcseconds). Now, many of you will probably scoff at Brahe's “generous” estimate of the size of Vega, yet here’s a comparative graphic I made to illustrate what this would look like:

Large dot = the Sun. Small dot = a 1st magnitude star such as Vega, visually 16 times smaller than the Sun, according to Tycho Brahe.
