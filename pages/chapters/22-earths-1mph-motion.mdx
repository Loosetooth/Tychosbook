Deconstructing Bradley and Einstein
======================================

If there were some sort of posthumous "Nobel prize" dedicated to the preservation of the heliocentric theory, the award would probably have to be conferred to James Bradley and Albert Einstein. The latter, of course, needs no introduction - although most people may not know that his initial claim to fame was that of having 'definitively resolved the anomalous precession of Mercury's perihelion'(which threatened to falsify & invalidate the all-important Newtonian physics).    

Astronomer Royal James Bradley’s _Aberration of starlight theory_ is widely celebrated as the definitive proof of Earth’s motion around the Sun as it supposedly hurtles at supersonic speeds (90X the speed of sound) along a 300 Mkm-wide orbit.
