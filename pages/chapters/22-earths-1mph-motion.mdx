Chapter 12 — The implications of Earth's 1.6km/h motion
=======================================================================

In the previous chapter, we saw that Earth’s PVP orbit is about 2.642336 X smaller than the Sun’s orbit. We shall now see how Earth’s 1.6km/h-motion can, all by itself, account for the famed “precession of the equinoxes” - i.e. the observed revolution of the entire firmament (i.e. of all of the stars) around our planet. The completion of ONE such revolution is currently estimated at 25.5 thousand years (in the TYCHOS, the precise figure is 25344 solar years).  

Each year, planet Earth (traveling at 1.6 km/h) covers a distance of ≈14036 km along its PVP orbit. This distance equals amounts to **0.0039457%** of the PVP orbit’s circumference of 355,724,597 km. From one year to the next, the Earth and the Sun will thus meet up at a slightly 'earlier' point in space, by an amount corresponding to a **0.0039457% “slice”** of the solar orbit’s circumference.

If we multiply 14,035.85km by 2.642336 (so as to obtain the equivalent circle-sectional distance projected onto the Sun’s larger orbit) we obtain:

14,035.85 X 2.642336 ≈ 37,087.4 km (which is, in fact, **0.0039457%** of the Sun's orbital circumference of 939,943,910km). 

Here is how this can be illustrated:

In our epoch (2000AD), the firmament is observed to drift 'eastwards' by about 50.3" arcseconds annually. However, as I shall expound and illustrate further on in this chapter, the _true_ annual eastward drift of the firmament is 51.136" arcseconds (about 1.68% more than the observable drift).

Note that 51.136" arcseconds equals:

51.136 = **0.0039457%** of 1,296,000 arcseconds (_i.e.;_ **0.0039457%** of 360°)

And in fact, **0.0039457%** X 25344 (the number of years in a TYCHOS Great Year) ≈ 100%

Hence, the so-called "precession of the equinoxes" is quite simply due to Earth’s clockwise motion around its PVP orbit.

Further on, we shall see how our current Gregorian year count tries to "compensate" for this inconvenient state of affairs. This will ultimately generate some serious problems with regards to the seasonal Earth-Sun-Stars alignments. In its attempt to compensate for Earth’s slow yet inexorable motion around its orbit, the Gregorian calendar’s less-than-ideal year count will cause our system (in 25344 years time) to end up almost exactly “upside-down”. In other words, the current declinations (i.e. celestial latitudes) of the Sun in June and December will be inverted!
