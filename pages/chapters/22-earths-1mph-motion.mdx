Chapter 22 — Earth’s 1 mph motion explains the “Equinoctial Precession”
=======================================================================

Earlier on, we saw that Earth’s PVP orbit is 2.642336 X smaller than the Sun’s orbit. We shall now see how Earth’s 1-mph-motion can, all by itself, account for the famed “precession of the equinoxes”, currently estimated to last for circa 25 to 26 thousand years.

Each year, Earth travels 14,035.85 km. If we multiply this value by 2.642336 (so as to radially project this distance onto the Sun’s larger orbit) we obtain:

14,035.847 X 2.642336 ≈ 37,087.424 km

Remember that, in the TYCHOS, Earth’s orbital speed is a mere 0.00149326% of that of the Sun. Since Earth’s orbit is 2.642336X smaller than the Sun’s orbit, we will therefore have to multiply our PVP Constant (0.00149326) by 2.642336 in order to obtain the solar orbit’s radial (or circle-sectional) equivalence of Earth’s motion vis-à-vis Sun’s orbit.

Here is what we obtain:

**0.00149326%** X 2.642336 ≈ **0.0039457%**

Note that 51.136 arc seconds (our ACP) equals:

51.136 = **0.00394570%** of 1,296,000 arcseconds (_i.e.;_ **0.00394570%** of 360°)

In fact, **0.00394570%** X 25344 (the number of years in a TYCHOS Great Year) = 99.999%

And **0.00394570%** of 9,256,896 days (_i.e.;_ the number of days in one TGY) ≈ **365.25** days.

Ergo, in one year, the Sun covers **0.00394570%** of its full 25344-year long TGY journey (of 25344 X 939,943,910 km).

In one year, planet Earth, traveling at about 1.6 km/h, will cover a distance that equals **0.00394570%** of the PVP orbit’s circumference of 355,724,597 km. From one year to the next, the Earth and the Sun will thus meet up at a slightly “earlier” point of the Sun’s orbit by an annual angular amount corresponding to roughly a **0.0039457% “slice”** of the solar orbit’s circumference: 37,087.424 km

Hence, it logically follows that the so-called “equinoctial precession” (the observed lateral drift which constantly shifts the Earth-to-Sun-to-Stars alignment) is a _**direct consequence**_ of Earth’s clockwise 1 mph-motion around its PVP orbit.

Further on, we shall see how our current Gregorian calendar count tries to compensate for this inconvenient offset. This will ultimately (over millennia) generate some serious problems with regards to the seasonal Earth-Sun-Stars alignments. In its attempt to compensate for Earth’s slow yet inexorable motion around its orbit, the Gregorian calendar’s less-than-ideal year count will cause our system (in 25,344 years of 365.24219 days) to end up “upside-down” in relation to the stars. This will, given due time, “invert” the seasons. It is a wrong way to track time, and should be thrown out.
