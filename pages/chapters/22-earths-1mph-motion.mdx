Chapter 12 — The implications of Earth's motion around the PVP orbit
=======================================================================

In the previous chapter, we saw that Earth’s PVP orbit is 2.642336X smaller than the Sun’s orbit. We shall now see how Earth’s 1.6km/h-motion can, all by itself, account for the famed “precession of the equinoxes” - i.e. the observed revolution of the entire firmament (i.e. of all of the stars) around our planet. The completion of ONE such revolution is currently estimated at 25.5 thousand years (in the TYCHOS, the precise figure is 25344 solar years).  

Each year, planet Earth (traveling at 1.6 km/h) covers a distance of ≈14036 km along its PVP orbit. This distance equals amounts to **0.0039457%** of the PVP orbit’s circumference of 355,724,597 km. From one year to the next, the Earth and the Sun will thus meet up at a slightly 'earlier' point in space, by an amount corresponding to a **0.0039457% “slice”** of the solar orbit’s circumference.

If we multiply 14,035.85km by 2.642336 (so as to obtain the equivalent circle-sectional distance projected onto the Sun’s larger orbit) we obtain:

14,035.85 X 2.642336 ≈ 37,087.4 km (which is, in fact, **0.0039457%** of the Sun's orbital circumference of 939,943,910km). 

Here is how this can be illustrated:

In our epoch (2000AD), the firmament is observed to drift 'eastwards' by about 50.3" arcseconds annually. However, as I shall expound and illustrate further on in this chapter, the _true_ annual eastward drift of the firmament is **51.136" arcseconds** (i.e. about 1.68% more than the observable drift).

**Please take note of this 51.136" figure which I will henceforth refer to as the 'ACP'(Annual Constant of Precession)**

Note that 51.136" arcseconds equals:

51.136 = **0.0039457%** of 1,296,000 arcseconds (_i.e.;_ **0.0039457%** of 360°)

And in fact, **0.0039457%** X 25344 (the number of years in a TYCHOS Great Year) ≈ 100%

Hence, the so-called "precession of the equinoxes" is quite simply due to Earth’s clockwise motion around its PVP orbit.

Further on, we shall see how our current Gregorian year count tries to "compensate" for this inconvenient state of affairs. This will ultimately generate some serious problems with regards to the seasonal Earth-Sun-Stars alignments. In its attempt to compensate for Earth’s slow yet inexorable motion around its orbit, the Gregorian calendar’s less-than-ideal year count will cause our system (in 25344 years time) to end up almost exactly “upside-down” in relation to the firmament. In other words, the current June and December declinations (i.e. celestial latitudes) of the Sun will be _inverted_... NOT a desirable situation! 


### The “Solar Day” versus the “Sidereal Day”

We shall now verify how the TYCHOS model fares with regards to the daily solar & sidereal periods. 

In the TYCHOS, the solar day is accounted for and explained as follows: after one revolution around its axis, Earth realigns with a given star in 1436 minutes (or 23 hours 56 minutes). However, during that time, the Sun has moved along “Eastwards” in relation to the stars. Hence, an earthly observer will have to wait another 4 minutes (or more precisely, 3.93 minutes on average) to realign with the Sun. Here's how this can be illustrated:

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/081_SOLAR_&_SIDEREAL_DAY_01.jpg)

You may agree that the TYCHOS model accounts for the solar & sidereal days in the simplest imaginable manner. 

As we shall see shortly, the Copernican theory’s explanation for the solar and sidereal days is not only complicated; it is inherently unphysical.

Wiktionary’s definition of “[unphysical](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKT-Feb-2017_Unphysical.pdf)”: _"Not supported by, or contrary to, the laws of physics."_

**The Sun moves by about 1° (or 4 minutes of RA) every day**

This fact alone suggests that it is indeed the Sun (and not Earth) that moves each day by 2,573,426km, for this value equals approximately 2X the Sun’s diameter of 1,391,400 km. Since the Sun’s apparent size in the sky subtends about 0.5°, it makes perfect optical sense that its observed daily displacement (of about 1°) amounts to about twice its visible diameter.

Let us now verify if the notion that the Sun orbits around Earth (and not vice versa) can be further confirmed.

As we divide the Sun’s orbital circumference (939,943,910km) by 1,296,000 arcseconds (360°) we obtain:

939,943,910 / 1,296,000 ≈ 725.265 km

Here is what we can read on Wikipedia’s “[Angular diameter](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Angular_diameter.pdf)” entry:

> “an object of diameter 725.27 km at a distance of 1 AU (average Earth > Sun distance) will have an angular diameter of one arcsecond”

We may now verify how many kilometers of the Sun’s orbital circumference will be subtended by our ACP of 51.136 arc seconds:

51.136 X 725.27 km ≈ **37,087.4km**

This is excellent confirmation of our above estimate of **37,087.4**km for the annual offset of the Sun’s position against the starry background (caused by Earth’s yearly 14,035.85km motion), representing 0.0039457% of the Sun’s orbital circumference.

One could also put it this way: since 51.136” is 0.05681 minutes of time

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/083_ConvertArcSecs_to_MinOfTime_02.jpg)Above — source: www.kylesconverter.com

We find that: 0.05681 min. X 25344 = **1440 min.** (360°)

Remember, we measure our celestial sphere by means of a spherical ruler divided in 1440 minutes - or 24 hours.

Once more, it would seem that our 25344-year reckoning of the Great Year holds up quite nicely.

Next, let us unpack how the solar & sidereal days are 'explained' by the Copernican heliocentric theory.

****************************************************************************************************************************


### Solar versus Sidereal Day as of Heliocentric theory

Here follows a classic diagram illustrating the proposed Copernican explanation for the different lengths of the solar and sidereal day. Keep in mind that Earth is supposedly traveling for over 2.5 Million km every day (!) while no parallax whatsoever between the Sun and the stars is observed. This would be measured at the completion of one sidereal day, and yet this parallax is absent. Once again, the Copernican explanation for this undeniable fact is that “the stars are almost unimaginably distant”. However, as we take a closer look, this proposed explication doesn’t make physical / optical sense.

Here’s how the occurrence of the sidereal day and solar day (or 'civil day') is conventionally illustrated.

In the above graphic, Earth is supposed to have moved 2.5 Mkm between the positions of “Day 1” and “Day 2”. Let us examine what this classic Copernican diagram is trying to say, quite carefully.

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/085_SiderealDayProblemCopernican_01.jpg)

To think that Earth would be moving by over 2.5 Million km each day without the background stars drifting by any noticeable amount besides these last 4 minutes of earthly rotation has to be among the most surreal aspects of the Copernican model!

To put this problem into due perspective, let´s see how the sidereal and solar day unfold in the below 3-frame sequence.

### The Sidereal vs. Solar Day (23h56min versus 24h00 min) as depicted by the NEAVE planetarium

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/086_STAR_SUN_PARALLAX_equiv_trio.01.jpg)

The following description is what is observed, in reality, from one day to the next:

In 23h56m, an earthly observer will line up again with the same given star. At such a point and time, the Sun will already have moved eastwards by approximately 4 minutes of RA. Four minutes later, we see the stars drifting by 4 min of RA westwards.

Ergo, the **entire amount** of our daily, Westward stellar drift will appear (to an earthly observer) to occur in the last 4 minutes of earthly rotation. In other words, Earth might just as well be stationary while only rotating around its axis. Many astronomers in ancient times believed this to be true - and understandably so. This wasn’t because they were stupid, but because this is what matches careful and patient observation of the Sun's behavior.

Of course, the TYCHOS model submits that Earth moves by a mere 38.4 km per day, which is hardly a noticeable amount of lateral displacement to the naked eye! Those 4 min. of RA are the consequence of Earth having rotated by 360° in 23h56min, thus needing another 4 minutes to line up again with the Sun. Meanwhile, the Sun has been moving Eastwards by about 4 minutes of RA.

Instead, the Copernican theory would have you believe that Earth is moving each day by 2.5 Million kilometers with _no amount_ of the observed, daily 4-minute stellar drift that can be optically attributed to this distance. It is as if the Earth’s rotation is the only thing that changes the star positions, but Earth’s (supposed) 2.5-Mkm daily displacement has no effect!
