Chapter 31 - List of puzzles solved by the TYCHOS
==================================================================

This final chapter will review and summarize the many astronomical puzzles resolved by the Tychos model. The reader is encouraged to share this "list of puzzles solved by the Tychos" with anyone who might wonder why the Tychos model deserves to be seriously considered as the proper configuration of our Solar System - and why the Copernican theory needs to be definitively discarded. 

The Tychos model differs from the Copernican model in numerous important aspects, which confer on it a vastly greater explanatory power. To help readers memorize these differences and their relevance to our understanding of the Solar System we inhabit, I have put together the checklist below. Each item has been exhaustively cross-verified with the observational data produced over the centuries by the world’s most eminent and committed astronomers.

It is a commonly held misconception that the heliocentric theory, as proposed by Copernicus and Kepler many centuries ago, has by now been fully confirmed as the only true and correct system of our world. When questioned about it, most earnest astronomers and cosmologists will openly admit that many empirical/ observational realities remain unaccounted for, lacking a solid and wholly satisfactory explanation.

An extensive series of long-standing, yet to this day unsettled, riddles and mysteries of astronomy are shown to be effectively resolved and/or elucidated by the core principles of the Tychos model - and its geometric layout. Below is a practical overview of its most significant argumentations, discoveries and logically formulated conclusions, with an indication of the chapters of this book where they are more extensively expounded and illustrated.

•  **Why only Mercury and Venus have no moons.** In the Tychos model, Mercury and Venus are moonless simply because they are the Sun’s moons and, as we can read in the Wikipedia'a ["Natural Satellite" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite), _“no moons of moons or subsatellites (natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet) are currently known as of 2019.“_ Also, it is no coincidence that Mercury and Venus rotate around their axes at “walking pace”, respectively 3 and 6 times slower than our Moon (5.5 km/h and 2.7 km/h). None of our planets rotate anywhere near as slowly (e.g. Jupiter: 43,000 km/h and Saturn: 35,000 km/h). That such a striking contrast between the Mercury/Venus duo and the rest of our planets has gone unnoticed to this day by our world's astronomers is a mystery in itself. _(see end of Chapter 3)_ 

• **Why Venus appears to Copernican observers to rotate around its axis in a clockwise direction.** In reality, Venus rotates counterclockwise, just like all the other components of our Solar System. The illusion of its apparent clockwise rotation is upheld by the notion that Earth rotates around it - and not vice versa - during Venus' 1.6-year (or 584.4-day) synodic period. _(see Chapter 8)_

• **The reason for the “precession of the equinoxes” and why our North Stars change over time.** The precession of the equinoxes is the observed, annual ‘retrograde’/ eastward drift of the stars, as well-documented ever since antiquity. But, as has been proven by a number of recent studies, Earth does not slowly “wobble” in the opposite direction of its axial rotation (a most bizarre and unphysical hypothesis). Hence, the Copernican theory is left, incredibly enough, without an explanation for the aforementioned, indisputable observations! In the Tychos, what is known today as the “general precession” is simply caused by Earth’s slow, clockwise motion around its 25344-year circular Polaris-Vega-Polaris (PVP) orbit. _(see Chapter 11)_

• **Why our Moon appears to be the “central driveshaft” of our entire solar system.** Its 29.22-day mean synodic period would seem utterly mysterious under the Copernican model’s heliocentric configuration. Why is our Moon’s period reflected in exact integer multiples by all the components of our system? If the Moon were just one of many satellites revolving around the various planets in our system, why would its revolutions be "resonant" with all of our planets' orbital periods? In the Tychos, all of this becomes a far less mysterious affair: the Moon revolves around Earth, located at the very center of our Sun-Mars binary system - and will thus naturally appear to be the "central driveshaft" of our entire Solar System. _(see Chapter 13 and Chapter 16)_ 

• **Why planets retrograde periodically the way they do.** Current explanations for our planet's periodic (and irregular) retrograde motions are directly contradicted by the most basic laws of perspective: if the retrograde motions were caused by speed differentials (between Earth and the planets), then the width and duration of a given planet's retrograde motions should INCREASE (in relation to the background stars) as it transits closer to Earth. As it transits further from Earth, it should DECREASE. Instead, the _exact opposite_ is observed! The Tychos provides geometrically rigorous and empirically-supported demonstrations for these all-important observed phenomena which have puzzled our world’s astronomers for millennia. _(see Chapter 5 and Chapter 29)_ 

• **Why the solar day is longer than the sidereal day - and the solar year is shorter than the sidereal year.** These two well-known facts still lack a satisfactory explanation under the Copernican theory’s geometric layout. The Tychos provides the simplest imaginable explanations for these apparently contradictory (yet empirically-verifiable) observations. _(see Chapter 12)_

• **Why our Moon lines up with the same star every 27.3 days.** If Earth and the Moon hurtled at 107,226 km/h around the Sun (as claimed by heliocentrists), they would both travel around a circle by about 70 million km every 27.3 days. Yet, the Moon is observed to conjunct with the very same star every 27.3 days! In the Tychos, this is no mystery since the Earth-Moon system moves at “snail pace”. Note that 27.3 days is also, remarkably, the time employed by the Sun to rotate once around its own axis. _(see Chapter 13)_

• **Why the Moon's perigee and apogee oscillate by 14036km and 42108km.** The Moon's perigees (its closest transits from Earth) and apogees (its furthest transits from Earth) are observed to oscillate by respectively 14036km and 42108km (i.e. 3X 14036). These distances _precisely_ reflect (at a 3:1 ratio) Earth's annual motion around its PVP orbit - as computed in the TYCHOS model. For this to be entirely coincidental is beyond rational thought. _(see Chapter 13)_     

• **The reasons for the curious 8-shaped Analemma traced by the Sun and for our need of the 'equation of time'.** The analemma turns out to be Earth’s “speedometer” since it reflects the orbital velocity of Earth (1.6 km/h), as graphically and mathematically demonstrated in the Tychos model. To be sure, current theory lacks a scientific explanation for the apparent solar accelerations and decelerations: since the Sun is observed to “accelerate” (which, in the Copernican model, would be equivalent to Earth speeding up) between June and mid-July, i.e. when Earth is furthest from the Sun, the core principles of Kepler’s and Newton’s famous laws of motion and gravitation are categorically falsified in one fell swoop. This is because their laws predict that Earth will _decelerate_ as it transits furthest from the Sun - i.e. the opposite of what is observed! _(see Chapter 21)_

• **Why Kepler erroneously concluded that all planetary orbits must be elliptical and that planets have variable speeds.** In the Tychos, all orbits are uniformly circular and all celestial bodies travel at constant speeds. Since they all revolve around Earth (as it slowly proceeds in roughly the “same direction”), they will alternately travel in the same or in the opposite direction of Earth’s motion. This creates the “space-time” illusion that Kepler fell for.

• **The 'failure' of the Michelson-Morley experiments.** The numerous interferometer experiments which attempted to detect the supposed hypersonic motion of Earth  around the Sun and through the ether all 'miserably failed' (as stated in academic astronomy literature). However, at a closer scrutiny, the very small ("near-null") velocities recorded by the most advanced of these experiments can actually be shown to support Earth's orbital speed of 1.6km/h - as proposed by the TYCHOS. Moreover, Michelson is even quoted as saying that he _“thought of the possibility that the solar system as a whole might have moved in the opposite direction to the Earth”._ This is, of course, precisely what Earth does in the Tychos model: it slowly moves in the opposite direction of all the 'family members' of our Solar System._(see chapter 24)_

• **James Bradley’s “aberration of light” theory.** Bradley's bizarre theory (which was soon disproven by "Airy’s failure"), was yet another attempt to rescue the Copernican model from its looming demise. The peculiar annual motion of the stars (wholly unexpected under the heliocentric theory) is simply due to the trochoidal curve / frame of reference around which earthly observers revolve every year. Bradley’s widely acclaimed _“definitive proof of Earth’s revolution around the Sun”_ is thus roundly falsified - beyond appeal. _(see Chapter 24)_
