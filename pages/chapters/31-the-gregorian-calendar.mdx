Chapter 31 - Puzzles solved by the TYCHOS
==================================================================

This chapter will review and summarize the many astronomical puzzles resolved by the Tychos model. The reader is encouraged to share this chapter with anyone who might wonder why the Tychos deserves to be seriously considered as the proper configuration of our Solar System - and why the Copernican theory needs to be definitively discarded.

The Tychos model differs from the Copernican model in numerous important aspects, which confer on it a vastly greater explanatory power. To help readers memorize these differences and their relevance to our understanding of the Solar System we inhabit, I have put together the checklist below. Each item has been exhaustively cross-verified with the observational data produced over the centuries by the world’s most eminent and committed astronomers.

It is a commonly held misconception that the heliocentric theory, as proposed by Copernicus and Kepler many centuries ago, has by now been fully confirmed as the only true and correct system of our world. When questioned about it, most earnest astronomers and cosmologists will openly admit that many empirical/ observational realities remain unaccounted for, lacking a solid and wholly satisfactory explanation.

An extensive series of long-standing, yet to this day unsettled, riddles and mysteries of astronomy are shown to be effectively resolved and/or elucidated by the core principles of the Tychos model - and its geometric layout. Below is a practical overview of its most significant argumentations, discoveries and logically formulated conclusions, with an indication of the chapters of this book where they are more extensively expounded and illustrated.

•  **Why only Mercury and Venus have no moons.** In the Tychos model, Mercury and Venus are moonless simply because they are the Sun’s moons and, as we can read in the Wikipedia'a ["Natural Satellite" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite), _“no moons of moons or subsatellites (natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet) are currently known as of 2019.“_ Also, it is no coincidence that Mercury and Venus rotate around their axes at “walking pace”, respectively 3 and 6 times slower than our Moon (5.5 km/h and 2.7 km/h). None of our planets rotate anywhere near as slowly (e.g. Jupiter: 43,000 km/h and Saturn: 35,000 km/h). That such a striking contrast between the Mercury/Venus duo and the rest of our planets has gone unnoticed to this day by our world's astronomers is a mystery in itself. (see end of Chapter 3) 

• **Why Venus appears to Copernican observers to rotate around its axis in a clockwise direction.** In reality, Venus rotates counterclockwise, just like all the other components of our Solar System. The illusion of its apparent clockwise rotation is upheld by the notion that Earth rotates around it - and not vice versa - during Venus' 1.6-year (or 584.4-day) synodic period. (see Chapter 8)

• **Why our Moon appears to be the “central driveshaft” of our entire solar system.** Its 29.22-day mean synodic period would seem utterly mysterious under the Copernican model’s heliocentric configuration. Why is our Moon’s period reflected in exact integer multiples by all the components of our system? If the Moon were just one of many satellites revolving around the various planets in our system, why would its revolutions be "resonant" with all of our planets' orbital periods? In the Tychos, all of this becomes a far less mysterious affair: the Moon revolves around Earth, located at the very center of our Sun-Mars binary system - and will thus naturally appear to be the "central driveshaft" of our entire Solar System. (see Chapter 13 and Chapter 16) 

• **Why planets retrograde periodically the way they do.** Current explanations for our planet's periodic (and irregular) retrograde motions are directly contradicted by the most basic laws of perspective: if the retrograde motions were caused by speed differentials (between Earth and the planets), then the width and duration of a given planet's retrograde motions should INCREASE (in relation to the background stars) as it transits closer to Earth. As it transits further from Earth, it should DECREASE. Instead, the _exact opposite_ is observed! The Tychos provides geometrically rigorous and empirically-supported demonstrations for these all-important observed phenomena which have puzzled our world’s astronomers for millennia.  (see Chapter 5 and Chapter 29)
