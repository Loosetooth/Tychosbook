Chapter 31 - List of puzzles solved by the TYCHOS
==================================================================

This final chapter will review and summarize the many astronomical puzzles resolved by the Tychos model. The reader is encouraged to share this "list of puzzles solved by the Tychos" with anyone who might wonder why the Tychos model (based on Tycho Brahe's original geoheliocentric system) deserves to be seriously considered - and why the Copernican theory needs to be definitively discarded. 

The Tychos model differs from the Copernican model in numerous important aspects, which confer on it a vastly greater explanatory power. To help readers memorize these differences and their relevance to our understanding of the Solar System we inhabit, I have put together the checklist below. Each item has been exhaustively cross-verified with the observational data produced over the centuries by the world’s most eminent and committed astronomers.

It is a commonly held misconception that the heliocentric theory, as proposed by Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo many centuries ago, has by now been fully confirmed as the only true and correct system of our world. When questioned about it, most earnest astronomers and cosmologists will openly admit that many empirical/ observational realities remain unaccounted for, lacking a solid and wholly satisfactory explanation.

An extensive series of long-standing, yet to this day unsettled, riddles and mysteries of astronomy are shown to be effectively resolved and/or elucidated by the core principles of the Tychos model - and its geometric layout. Below is a practical overview of its most significant argumentations, discoveries and logically- formulated conclusions, with an indication of the chapters of this book where they are more extensively expounded and illustrated.

***************************************************************************************************************************************

• **Why would our Sun have a binary companion?** As it is, a better and far more sensible question would be: "why would our Sun _not_ have a binary companion?"_ We know today that the vast majority (or quite possibly _100%_) of the visible stars in our skies revolve around a smaller companion (in intersecting orbits and around their common barycenter). Hence, the notion that our Sun would be the only 'bachelor' of our Universe should alert any rational thinker to its inherent absurdity. _(see Chapter 2)_

•  **Why only Mercury and Venus have no moons.** In the Tychos model, Mercury and Venus are moonless simply because they are the Sun’s moons and, as we can read in the Wikipedia'a ["Natural Satellite" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite), _“no moons of moons or subsatellites (natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet) are currently known as of 2019.“_ Also, it is no coincidence that Mercury and Venus rotate around their axes at “walking pace”, respectively 3 and 6 times slower than our Moon (5.5 km/h and 2.7 km/h). None of our planets rotate anywhere near as slowly (e.g. Jupiter: 43,000 km/h and Saturn: 35,000 km/h). That such a striking contrast between the Mercury/Venus duo and the rest of our planets has gone unnoticed to this day by our world's astronomers is a mystery in itself. _(see end of Chapter 3)_ 

• **Why both Mars and the Sun exhibit 79-year cycles - as well as cycles locked at a 2:1 ratio.** Under the Copernican model, this little-known fact could only be attributed to some bizarre, “cosmic happenstance”. Under the Tychos paradigm however, these findings are not by any means unexpected, since the two bodies make up a binary pair. For them to exhibit resonant long-term cycles is perfectly consistent with the Tychos model's core principles. _(see Chapters 5 & 9)_

• **Why planets retrograde periodically the way they do.** Current explanations for our planet's periodic (and irregular) retrograde motions are directly contradicted by the most basic laws of perspective: if the retrograde motions were caused by speed differentials (between Earth and the planets), then the width and duration of a given planet's retrograde motions should INCREASE (in relation to the background stars) as it transits closer to Earth. As it transits further from Earth, it should DECREASE. Instead, the _exact opposite_ is observed! The Tychos provides geometrically rigorous and empirically-supported demonstrations for these all-important observed phenomena which have puzzled our world’s astronomers for millennia. _(see Chapter 5 and Chapter 29)_ 

• **Why are Sirius A and Sirius B proportionally identical to the Sun and Mars?"** This remains an open question which, however, certainly deserves our utmost attention. To dismiss this fact as a 'random cosmic coincidence' cannot be an acceptable argument within any serious scientific discourse. In any event, the idea that the Sirius binary system may be a "twin" of our Solar System - the two therefore constituting a so-called "double-double" system - is not new: in later decades, it has been put forth by several independent research groups (e.g. by the Binary Research Institute) - and is now supported by a host of compelling arguments and empirical evidence. _(see Chapter 6)_     

• **Why Mars can occasionally line up (as viewed from Earth) with the same star within a ca. 546- day period.** Mars-star alignments occur most frequently (7 out of 8 times) every 707 days or so. In the Tychos model, this is shown to be a plain and natural geometric consequence of the peculiar, “spirographic” motion of Mars around our planet. As the Copernican theory has it, this 546-day alignment with the very same star (that habitually lines up with Mars every 707 days) would
somehow occur in spite of Earth and Mars having both moved laterally by about 300 million kilometers. _(see Chapter 7)_

• **Why Venus appears to Copernican observers to rotate around its axis in a clockwise direction.** In reality, Venus rotates counterclockwise, just like all the other components of our Solar System. The illusion of its apparent clockwise (or 'retrograde') rotation is upheld by the notion that Earth rotates around it - and not vice versa - during Venus' 1.6-year (or 584.4-day) synodic period. In other words, it is a 'Copernican illusion'. _(see Chapter 8)_

• **Why the orbits of Mercury and Venus are co-planar with the Sun's equatorial ecliptic.** As can be verified in the Tychosium 3D simulator, the orbits of Mercury and Venus are perennially inclined (in relation to our Solar System's 'mean plane') at about 6° or 7° - much like our Sun's "mysterious" axial obliquity (a still unresolved enigma of astrophysics). This constitutes indisputable evidence that Mercury and Venus are the Sun's two moons. _(see Chapter 9)_   

• **The reason for the “precession of the equinoxes” and why our North Stars change over time.** The precession of the equinoxes (or "General Precession") is the observed, annual ‘retrograde’/ eastward drift of the stars, as well-documented ever since antiquity. But, as has been thoroughly demonstrated by a number of recent studies, Earth does _not_ slowly wobble in the opposite direction of its axial rotation (a most fanciful and unphysical hypothesis). Hence, the Copernican theory is left, incredibly enough, without an explanation for the observed and all-important General Precession! In the Tychos, the General Precession is simply caused by Earth’s slow, clockwise motion around its 25344-year circular "PVP" orbit (Polaris-Vega-Polaris). _(see Chapter 11)_

• **Why the solar day is longer than the sidereal day - and the solar year is shorter than the sidereal year.** These two well-known facts still lack a satisfactory explanation under the Copernican theory’s geometric layout. The Tychos provides the simplest imaginable explanations for these apparently contradictory (yet empirically-verifiable) observations. _(see Chapter 12)_

• **Why our Moon appears to be the “central driveshaft” of our entire solar system.** Its 29.22-day mean synodic period would seem utterly mysterious under the Copernican model’s heliocentric configuration. Why is our Moon’s period reflected in exact integer multiples by all the components of our system? To wit, if the Moon were just one of many satellites revolving around the various planets in our system, why would its revolutions be "resonant" with all of our planets' orbital periods? In the Tychos, all of this becomes a far less mysterious affair: the Moon revolves around Earth, located at the very center of our Sun-Mars binary system - and will thus naturally appear to be the "central driveshaft" of our entire Solar System. _(see Chapter 13 and Chapter 16)_ 

• **Why our Moon lines up with the same star every 27.3 days.** If Earth and the Moon hurtled at 107,226 km/h around the Sun (as claimed by heliocentrists), they would both travel around a circle by about 70 million km every 27.3 days. Yet, the Moon is observed to conjunct with the very same star every 27.3 days! In the Tychos, this is no mystery since the Earth-Moon system moves at “snail pace”. Note that 27.3 days is also, remarkably, the time employed by the Sun to rotate once around its own axis. _(see Chapter 13)_

• **Why the Moon's perigee and apogee oscillate by 14036km and 42108km.** The Moon's perigees (its closest transits from Earth) and apogees (its furthest transits from Earth) are observed to oscillate by respectively 14036km and 42108km (i.e. 3X 14036). These distances _precisely_ reflect (at a 3:1 ratio) Earth's annual motion around its PVP orbit - as computed in the TYCHOS model. For this to be entirely coincidental is beyond rational consideration _(see Chapter 13)_    

• **Why our Moon appears or is believed to accelerate in relation to the “fixed” stars.** This is no more than an illusory conclusion drawn by heliocentrists which the Tychos can readily explain and demonstrate - geometrically and mathematically. _(see Chapter 14)_

• **Why our largest meteor showers recur at regular annual intervals.** According to current theory, our most famous meteor showers are caused by Earth regularly (i.e. every year at specific dates) smashing into the cometary dust-trails left over by various comets (none of them returning on a yearly basis!). The Tychos submits a more reasonable explanation for the recurrence of our largest meteor showers, showing that they correspond to the regularly-intersecting orbital paths of the Sun and Mars._(see Chapter 15)_   

• **Why the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn appear to be "chaotic"**. At the end of the 19th century, what astronomers called "the Great Inequality" concerned the observed fluctuations of Jupiter's and Saturn's conjunctions. It triggered a humongous debate between our world's top scientists because, according to Newton's laws, it meant that Jupiter would inevitably end up crashing into the Sun, while Saturn would be driven away into the depths of space. In other words, the very stability (and survival) of our Solar System was at stake! This 'alarming problem' was never truly solved - in spite of (convoluted) claims to the contrary. Once more, the Tychos can show that these irregular conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn are simply due to Earth's 1.6km/h-motion around its PVP orbit. _(see Chapter 17)_ 

• **Why Uranus, Neptune and Pluto support the Tychos' tenets.** The Tychos contends that all the orbital periods of our Solar System's planets are multiples of our Moon's synodic period (and thus, exact multiples of the Sun's 1-year orbital period). The only reason why we see Uranus, Neptune and Pluto returning to the same place in our skies in SLIGHTLY LESS than (respectively) 84, 165 and 228 years - is due to Earth's 1.6km/h motion around its PVP orbit. _see Chapter 18)_ 

• **Why do we need "leap years"?** The leap year - or the leap day of February 29 - can also be shown to be a necessity (to allow us to have a calendar of 365 integer days) caused by Earth's 'clockwise motion' around its PVP orbit._see Chapter 19)_ 

• **Why Mars is reckoned to have a “great cycle” of about 51,000 years.** This time span is very close to being twice the duration of the “Great Year” (25,344 years), as determined by the Tychos model. In the Tychos, the motions of the Sun and Mars are, of course, firmly “locked” at a 2:1 ratio (for every Martian revolution there are two solar revolutions); hence, it is fully expected that the “great cycle” of Mars would be twice as long as that of the Sun. _(see Chapter 20)_

• **Why Earth’s rotation appears or is believed to decelerate and its equinoctial precession to increase.** This is also an illusory conclusion drawn by heliocentrists which the Tychos can readily explain and demonstrate - geometrically and mathematically. _(see Chapter 20)_ 

• **The reasons for the curious 8-shaped 'Analemma' traced by the Sun and for our need of the Equation of Time'.** 
The principal cause for the Sun's 8-shaped, asymmetric annual displacement is the trochoidal path around which any observer will gyrate each year ("A Man's Yearly Path"). The analemma turns out to be Earth’s “speedometer” since it can be shown to reflect its 1.6 km/h orbital velocity - as posited by the Tychos model. Moreover, the analemma directly falsifies the current theory for the apparent solar (or earthly) accelerations and decelerations: this, because the Sun is observed to “accelerate” (which, in the heliocentric model, would be equivalent to Earth speeding up) between June and July, i.e. when Earth is furthest from the Sun. The core principles of Kepler’s and Newton’s laws of motion and gravitation are thus disproven - since they predict that Earth will _decelerate_ as it transits farthest from the Sun (i.e. the opposite of what is observed!) _(see Chapter 21)_

• **The flagrant fallacy of “the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion”.** This infamous and hotly-debated "anomaly" was purportedly resolved by Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, making him a world-famous celebrity overnight. The Tychos model shows that there is _no_ such anomaly whatsoever: the seemingly inexplicable extra 43″-per-century precession of Mercury’s perihelion is nothing but a natural and demonstrable corollary of the General Precession. Once we consider that Mercury revolves around Earth (and not vice versa), this spurious 'anomaly' simply disappears. _(see Chapter 22)_

• **Why we can see so many stars with our naked eyes.** Copernican astronomers tell us that the closest star system (the Proxima Centauri A and B duo and their "parents", the Alpha Cen A and Alpha Cen B binary pair) is some 4.3 light years away, while the farthest stars we can see with our unaided eyes are said to be up to 6000 light years away (or more)! These extraordinary claims become considerably less implausible in the Tychos model which posits that the stars are about 42633 times closer than currently believed. This is because star distances are estimated (using simple trigonometry) under the assumption that Earth moves laterally by 299.2 million km every six months. In the Tychos, however, Earth only moves by 7018 km every six months (i.e. 42633 times less than currently assumed). _see Chapter 23)_

• **The perceived relative speed of our solar system vis-à-vis the stars ”.** Our system is estimated to move at approximately 19.4 km/s in relation to the stars (or vice versa). Once more, the Tychos has a plain and simple explanation for this generally agreed-upon relative speed: if we convert 19.4 km/s to km/h, we obtain 69840 km/h. If we now divide 69840 by 42633 (the Tychos “reduction factor”), we obtain 1.638 km/h, or almost exactly 1.601169 km/h - the proposed orbital speed of Earth in the Tychos. As it is, the evidence available from observational data pointing to Earth’s 1.6 km/h orbital motion is overwhelming. _(see Chapter 23)

• **The 'failure' of the Michelson-Morley experiments.** The numerous interferometer experiments which attempted to detect the supposed hypersonic motion of Earth  around the Sun and through the ether all 'miserably failed' (as stated in academic astronomy literature). However, at a closer scrutiny, the very small ("near-null") velocities recorded by the most advanced of these experiments can actually be shown to support Earth's orbital speed of 1.6km/h - as proposed by the TYCHOS. Moreover, Michelson is even quoted as saying that he _“thought of the possibility that the solar system as a whole might have moved in the opposite direction to the Earth”._ This is, of course, precisely what Earth does in the Tychos model: it slowly moves in the opposite direction of all the 'family members' of our Solar System._(see chapter 24)_

• **James Bradley’s “aberration of light” theory.** Bradley's bizarre theory (which was soon to be disproved by "Airy’s failure"), was yet another attempt to rescue the Copernican model from its inevitable demise. The peculiar annual motion of the stars (wholly unexpected under the heliocentric theory) is simply due to the trochoidal curve / frame of reference ("A Man's Yearly Path") around which earthly observers revolve every year. Bradley’s widely-acclaimed _“definitive proof of Earth’s revolution around the Sun”_ is thus roundly falsified - beyond appeal. _(see Chapter 24)_

• **The existence of negative and zero parallax.** The currently inexplicable and apparently absurd so-called "negative stellar parallax" exhibited by a good 25% of our stars, as well as the baffling amount of stars (nearly 50%) registering zero parallax, can be shown to be natural corollaries of the Tychos geometry. In other words, the “mysterious” existence of three types of observed stellar parallaxes (positive, negative and zero) is to be fully expected in the Tychos model. Conversely, the existence of negative stellar parallax is a physical impossibility under the Copernican/heliocentric model. Note that the Tychos model does not negate the vast amount of stellar parallax data gathered to this day, but it actually provides a logical explanation for its observed distribution (i.e. roughly 25% positive, 25% negative, and 50% zero). _see Chapter 25)_

• **Why Kepler erroneously concluded that all planetary orbits must be elliptical and that planets have variable speeds.** In the Tychos, all orbits are uniformly circular and all celestial bodies travel at constant speeds. Since they all revolve around Earth (as it slowly proceeds in roughly the “same direction”), they will alternately travel in the same or in the opposite direction of Earth’s motion. This creates the “space-time” illusion that Kepler fell for. _(see end of Chapter 26)_

In conclusion, all of the extant, above-listed astronomical puzzles and quandaries find sensible and forthright answers when assessed within the Tychos paradigm and its proposed 1.6 km/h (or 1-mph) motion of Earth around its PVP orbit. In light of this, the Tychos model stands on solid ground, whereas the Copernican model emerges as an ultimately untenable proposition. It is often (and rightly) said that a scientific theory cannot be definitively proven as long as it can be falsified. I will now therefore humbly ask our world’s scientific community to spend a little time and endeavor to try and falsify the Tychos model’s tenets while observing the highest degree of intellectual honesty with regard to my rigorous interpretation of the vast volume of available observations gathered by our
world’s astronomers. I believe that, throughout my own research, I have observed a fair and respectful approach to their indefatigable efforts throughout the centuries. 

It is most unfortunate that Tycho Brahe’s and Pathani Samanta’s achievements have been all but obliterated from history in spite of their excellence and substantial validity. The Tychos model emphatically revives and vindicates their lifetime efforts - along with those of other industrious scientists whose work was either misunderstood, overlooked or simply ignored. I suggest that the time has come to do them justice and to reassess the configuration of our Solar System with a fresh and earnest outlook - free from heliocentric, relativist or Newtonian preconceptions. Needless to say, vigorous resistance to the paradigm-shifting Tychos model is to be fully expected - not least from academic circles, known for their abhorrence of new ideas that may challenge their venerated "icons of science" - and thus threaten their long-established, "inviolable Laws". However, I dare say that the "ball" (i.e. the burden of proof concerning the true configuration of our Solar System) now lies squarely in the heliocentrists' camp. In any event, I can only hope that the contents of this book will be carefully considered (by earnest astronomy experts and laymen alike), so as to start a collective and constructive intellectual debate - in the interest of all the inquisitive sons and daughters of Mother Earth. 

May reason prevail.
