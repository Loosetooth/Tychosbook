Chapter 31 - List of puzzles solved by the TYCHOS
==================================================================

This final chapter will review and summarize the many astronomical puzzles resolved by the Tychos model. The reader is encouraged to share this "list of puzzles solved by the Tychos" with anyone who might wonder why the Tychos model deserves to be seriously considered as the proper configuration of our Solar System - and why the Copernican theory needs to be definitively discarded. 

The Tychos model differs from the Copernican model in numerous important aspects, which confer on it a vastly greater explanatory power. To help readers memorize these differences and their relevance to our understanding of the Solar System we inhabit, I have put together the checklist below. Each item has been exhaustively cross-verified with the observational data produced over the centuries by the world’s most eminent and committed astronomers.

It is a commonly held misconception that the heliocentric theory, as proposed by Copernicus and Kepler many centuries ago, has by now been fully confirmed as the only true and correct system of our world. When questioned about it, most earnest astronomers and cosmologists will openly admit that many empirical/ observational realities remain unaccounted for, lacking a solid and wholly satisfactory explanation.

An extensive series of long-standing, yet to this day unsettled, riddles and mysteries of astronomy are shown to be effectively resolved and/or elucidated by the core principles of the Tychos model - and its geometric layout. Below is a practical overview of its most significant argumentations, discoveries and logically formulated conclusions, with an indication of the chapters of this book where they are more extensively expounded and illustrated.

•  **Why only Mercury and Venus have no moons.** In the Tychos model, Mercury and Venus are moonless simply because they are the Sun’s moons and, as we can read in the Wikipedia'a ["Natural Satellite" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite), _“no moons of moons or subsatellites (natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet) are currently known as of 2019.“_ Also, it is no coincidence that Mercury and Venus rotate around their axes at “walking pace”, respectively 3 and 6 times slower than our Moon (5.5 km/h and 2.7 km/h). None of our planets rotate anywhere near as slowly (e.g. Jupiter: 43,000 km/h and Saturn: 35,000 km/h). That such a striking contrast between the Mercury/Venus duo and the rest of our planets has gone unnoticed to this day by our world's astronomers is a mystery in itself. _(see end of Chapter 3)_ 

• **Why Venus appears to Copernican observers to rotate around its axis in a clockwise direction.** In reality, Venus rotates counterclockwise, just like all the other components of our Solar System. The illusion of its apparent clockwise rotation is upheld by the notion that Earth rotates around it - and not vice versa - during Venus' 1.6-year (or 584.4-day) synodic period. _(see Chapter 8)_

• **The reason for the “precession of the equinoxes” and why our North Stars change over time.** The precession of the equinoxes is the observed, annual ‘retrograde’/ eastward drift of the stars, as well-documented ever since antiquity. But, as has been proven by a number of recent studies, Earth does not slowly “wobble” in the opposite direction of its axial rotation (a most bizarre and unphysical hypothesis). Hence, the Copernican theory is left, incredibly enough, without an explanation for the aforementioned, indisputable observations! In the Tychos, what is known today as the “general precession” is simply caused by Earth’s slow, clockwise motion around its 25344-year circular Polaris-Vega-Polaris (PVP) orbit. _(see Chapter 11)_

• **Why our Moon appears to be the “central driveshaft” of our entire solar system.** Its 29.22-day mean synodic period would seem utterly mysterious under the Copernican model’s heliocentric configuration. Why is our Moon’s period reflected in exact integer multiples by all the components of our system? If the Moon were just one of many satellites revolving around the various planets in our system, why would its revolutions be "resonant" with all of our planets' orbital periods? In the Tychos, all of this becomes a far less mysterious affair: the Moon revolves around Earth, located at the very center of our Sun-Mars binary system - and will thus naturally appear to be the "central driveshaft" of our entire Solar System. _(see Chapter 13 and Chapter 16)_ 

• **Why planets retrograde periodically the way they do.** Current explanations for our planet's periodic (and irregular) retrograde motions are directly contradicted by the most basic laws of perspective: if the retrograde motions were caused by speed differentials (between Earth and the planets), then the width and duration of a given planet's retrograde motions should INCREASE (in relation to the background stars) as it transits closer to Earth. As it transits further from Earth, it should DECREASE. Instead, the _exact opposite_ is observed! The Tychos provides geometrically rigorous and empirically-supported demonstrations for these all-important observed phenomena which have puzzled our world’s astronomers for millennia. _(see Chapter 5 and Chapter 29)_ 

• **Why the solar day is longer than the sidereal day - and the solar year is shorter than the sidereal year.** These two well-known facts still lack a satisfactory explanation under the Copernican theory’s geometric layout. The Tychos provides the simplest imaginable explanations for these apparently contradictory (yet empirically-verifiable) observations. _(see Chapter 12)_

• **Why our Moon lines up with the same star every 27.3 days.** If Earth and the Moon hurtled at 107,226 km/h around the Sun (as claimed by heliocentrists), they would both travel around a circle by about 70 million km every 27.3 days. Yet, the Moon is observed to conjunct with the very same star every 27.3 days! In the Tychos, this is no mystery since the Earth-Moon system moves at “snail pace”. Note that 27.3 days is also, remarkably, the time employed by the Sun to rotate once around its own axis. _(see Chapter 13)_

• **Why the Moon's perigee and apogee oscillate by 14036km and 42108km.** The Moon's perigees (its closest transits from Earth) and apogees (its furthest transits from Earth) are observed to oscillate by respectively 14036km and 42108km (i.e. 3X 14036). These distances _precisely_ reflect (at a 3:1 ratio) Earth's annual motion around its PVP orbit - as computed in the TYCHOS model. For this to be entirely coincidental is beyond rational thought. _(see Chapter 13)_     

• **The reasons for the curious 8-shaped Analemma traced by the Sun and for our need of the 'equation of time'.** The analemma turns out to be Earth’s “speedometer” since it reflects the orbital velocity of Earth (1.6 km/h), as graphically and mathematically demonstrated in the Tychos model. To be sure, current theory lacks a scientific explanation for the apparent solar accelerations and decelerations: since the Sun is observed to “accelerate” (which, in the Copernican model, would be equivalent to Earth speeding up) between June and mid-July, i.e. when Earth is furthest from the Sun, the core principles of Kepler’s and Newton’s famous laws of motion and gravitation are categorically falsified in one fell swoop. This is because their laws predict that Earth will _decelerate_ as it transits furthest from the Sun - i.e. the opposite of what is observed! _(see Chapter 21)_

• **Why Kepler erroneously concluded that all planetary orbits must be elliptical and that planets have variable speeds.** In the Tychos, all orbits are uniformly circular and all celestial bodies travel at constant speeds. Since they all revolve around Earth (as it slowly proceeds in roughly the “same direction”), they will alternately travel in the same or in the opposite direction of Earth’s motion. This creates the “space-time” illusion that Kepler fell for.

• **The 'failure' of the Michelson-Morley experiments.** The numerous interferometer experiments which attempted to detect the supposed hypersonic motion of Earth  around the Sun and through the ether all 'miserably failed' (as stated in academic astronomy literature). However, at a closer scrutiny, the very small ("near-null") velocities recorded by the most advanced of these experiments can actually be shown to support Earth's orbital speed of 1.6km/h - as proposed by the TYCHOS. Moreover, Michelson is even quoted as saying that he _“thought of the possibility that the solar system as a whole might have moved in the opposite direction to the Earth”._ This is, of course, precisely what Earth does in the Tychos model: it slowly moves in the opposite direction of all the 'family members' of our Solar System._(see chapter 24)_

• **James Bradley’s “aberration of light” theory.** Bradley's bizarre theory (which was soon disproven by "Airy’s failure"), was yet another attempt to rescue the Copernican model from its looming demise. The peculiar annual motion of the stars (wholly unexpected under the heliocentric theory) is simply due to the trochoidal curve / frame of reference around which earthly observers revolve every year. Bradley’s widely acclaimed _“definitive proof of Earth’s revolution around the Sun”_ is thus roundly falsified - beyond appeal. _(see Chapter 24)_

• **The failure of the theory of the “anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion”.** This theory purportedly corroborated Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, making him a world-famous celebrity overnight. The Tychos model shows that there is no such anomaly and that the seemingly inexplicable extra 43″-per-century precession of Mercury’s perihelion is nothing but a natural and demonstrable corollary of the mercurial precession in relation to the “fixed” starry background, caused by Earth’s 1-mph motion around its PVP orbit. _(see Chapter 22)_

• **Why both Mars and the Sun exhibit peculiar 79-year cycles.** Under the Copernican model, this little-known fact could only be attributed to some bizarre “coincidence”. Under the Tychos paradigm however, this is no happenstance, nor by any means an unexpected finding, since the two bodies make up a binary pair. _(see Chapters 5 & 9)_

• **Why Mars is reckoned to have a “great cycle” of about 51,000 years.** This time span is very close to being twice the duration of the “Great Year” (25,344 years), as determined by the Tychos model. In the Tychos, the motions of the Sun and Mars are, of course, firmly “locked” at a 2:1 ratio (for every Martian revolution there are two solar revolutions), hence, it is fully expected that the “great cycle” of Mars would be twice as long as that of the Sun. _(see Chapter 20)_

• **Why Mars can occasionally line up (as viewed from Earth) with the same star within a ca. 550- day period.** Mars-star alignments occur most frequently (7 out of 8 times) every 707 days or so. In the Tychos model, this is shown to be a plain and natural geometric consequence of the peculiar, “spirographic” motion of Mars around our planet. As the Copernican theory has it, this 550-day alignment with the very same star that habitually lines up with Mars every 707 days would
somehow occur in spite of Earth and Mars having both moved laterally by about 300 million kilometers. _(see Chapter 7)_

• **Why Earth’s rotation appears or is believed to decelerate and its equinoctial precession to increase.**

• **Why our Moon appears or is believed to accelerate in relation to the “fixed” starry background.**

• **Why we can see so many stars with our naked eyes.** The closest star is allegedly some 4.3 light years away, while the farthest is said to be 16,308 light years away. Copernican astronomers tell us that “the farthest star we can see with our naked eye is V762 Cas in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 16,308 light years.” This quite extraordinary claim becomes considerably less extraordinary in the Tychos model which posits that the stars are about 42,633 times closer than
currently taught. This is because star distances are estimated using basic trigonometry under the assumption that Earth moves laterally by 299.2 million km every six months. In the Tychos, however, Earth only moves by 7,018 km every six months (i.e. 42,633 times less than currently assumed).

• **The existence of negative and zero parallax.** The currently inexplicable and apparently absurd so-called negative stellar parallax exhibited by a good 25% of our stars, as well as the baffling amount of stars (nearly 50%) registering zero parallax, can be shown to be natural corollaries of the Tychos geometry. In other words, the “mysterious” existence of three types of observed stellar parallaxes (positive, negative and zero) is to be fully expected in the Tychos model. Conversely, the existence of negative stellar parallax is a physical impossibility under the Copernican/heliocentric model. Important disclaimer: the Tychos model does not negate the vast amount of stellar parallax data gathered to this day, but provides a logical explanation for its observed distribution (i.e. roughly 25% positive, 25% negative, and 50% zero). _see Chapter 25)_

• **The perceived relative speed of our solar system vis-à-vis the stars ”.** Our system is estimated to move at approximately 19.4 km/s in relation to the stars (or vice versa). Once more, the Tychos has a plain and simple explanation for this generally agreed-upon relative speed: if we convert 19.4 km/s to km/h, we obtain 69,840 km/h. If we now divide 69,840 by 42,633 (the Tychos “reduction factor”), we obtain 1.638 km/h, or almost exactly 1.601169 km/h - the proposed orbital speed of Earth in the Tychos. As it is, the evidence available from observational data pointing to Earth’s 1.6 km/h orbital motion is overwhelming. _(see Chapter 23)

In conclusion, all of the extant, above-listed astronomical puzzles and quandaries find sensible and forthright answers when assessed within the Tychos paradigm and its proposed 1.6 km/h (or 1-mph) motion of Earth around its PVP orbit. In light of this, the Tychos model stands on solid ground, whereas the Copernican model emerges as an ultimately untenable proposition. It is often (and rightly) said that a scientific theory cannot be definitively proven as long as it can be falsified. I will now therefore humbly ask our world’s scientific community to spend a little time and endeavor to try and falsify the Tychos model’s tenets while observing the highest degree of intellectual honesty with regard to my rigorous interpretation of the vast volume of available observations gathered by our
world’s astronomers. I believe that, throughout my own research, I have observed a fair and respectful approach to their indefatigable efforts throughout the centuries. It is most unfortunate that Tycho Brahe’s and Pathani Samanta’s achievements have been all but obliterated from history in spite of their excellence and validity. The Tychos model emphatically revives and vindicates their lifetime efforts - along with those of other industrious scientists whose work was either misunderstood, overlooked or simply ignored. I suggest that the time has come to do them justice and to reassess the configuration of our Solar System with a fresh and earnest outlook - free from heliocentric, relativist or Newtonian preconceptions. May reason prevail.
