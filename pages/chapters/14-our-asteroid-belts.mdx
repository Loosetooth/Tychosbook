Chapter 14 — The Moon: curing Newton's headache
=====================================================


It is quite ironic that the greatest - and still ongoing - astronomical controversy of all times revolves around our own Moon’s motions. After all, the Moon is our largest, nearest and thus most intensely studied celestial body: shouldn’t our world’s scientific community have fully settled the matter by now, after all these centuries? How can the Moon’s motions still be such a hotly debated question? Here’s what we can read today at Wikipedia:

> “Lunar theory attempts to account for the motions of the Moon. There are many small variations (or perturbations) in the Moon’s motion, and many attempts have been made to account for them.” [Lunar Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_theory) 

Attempts. Just attempts. The “lunar theory” Wikipedia page goes on saying that “after centuries of being problematic, lunar motion is now modeled to a very high degree of accuracy.” Well, that is simply untrue since modern scientists are still looking to solve the Moon’s seemingly inexplicable and 'anomalous' orbital motions, as this abstract from a scientific study dated 2011 concludes:

> “Thus, the issue of finding a satisfactory explanation for the anomalous behavior of the Moon’s eccentricity remains open.” [On the anomalous secular increase of the eccentricity of the orbit of the Moon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0212)

As for Newton’s stance on the matter, the Moon’s motions were notoriously problematic - and caused him much misery and sleepless nights :

### “The motion of the Moon is very complicated. Sir Isaac Newton is supposed to have told his friend Halley that lunar theory ‘made his head ache and kept him awake so often that he would think of it no more." [Dynamics of the Sun-Earth-Moon system](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/010/08/0006-0024)

No wonder the Moon’s puzzling motions caused pain in poor Sir Isaac’s brain: they stubbornly refused to comply with his gravitational theories!

But let us have a quick look at what the Moon controversy was all about, as documented in the astronomy literature:

[The controversy surrounding the secular acceleration of the moon's mean motion](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00348444) 

To be sure, the Moon’s motions were (and still are) in serious conflict with Newton’s gravitational laws. It is a matter of historical record that Newton’s laws were contradicted by the Moon’s _“inexplicable, renegade behavior”_, and that this plain fact ignited a humongous, endless controversy among our world’s scientific community which, incredibly enough, remains unresolved to this day. Now, don’t let any smartass astronomer tell you otherwise (i.e. that “the Moon controversy was
eventually resolved”) for it would be a bare-faced lie which flies in the face of what has been repeatedly admitted in the earnest astronomy literature, as I am partially documenting here.

What astronomy students are taught today is that the Moon’s utterly bewildering motions were successively “resolved” by some of the most revered scientists of our times (e.g., Euler, Horrocks, Lagrange, Laplace, Clairaut, Dunthorne, Mayer, Einstein, to name but a few), all of whom contributed to constructing a vast number of “terms” and “perturbations” that would supposedly account for the Moon’s 'anomalous' motions. Eventually, a veritable hodge-podge of theories were formulated in order to rescue Newton’s “sacrosanct” gravitational laws. Here’s what we can read today on the “Lunar Theory” Wikipedia page (as linked above):

> “The analysts of the mid-18th century expressed the perturbations of the Moon’s position in longitude using about 25-30 trigonometrical terms. However, work in the nineteenth and twentieth century led to very different formulations of the theory so these terms are no longer current. The number of terms needed to express the Moon’s position with the accuracy sought at the beginning of the twentieth century was over 1400; and the number of terms needed to emulate the accuracy of modern numerical integrations based on laser-ranging observations is in the tens of thousands: there is no limit to the increase in number of terms needed as
requirements of accuracy increase.”

As you can see, there is apparently no limit to the increase of terms needed to explain the Moon’s motions. The numbers of these terms keep growing year by year. And most assuredly, our modern-day astronomy students are strongly discouraged from questioning the validity of the same. Today, it is “scientific heresy” to question the “established findings” of our world’s most acclaimed scientists. But let me submit a few more excerpts from the astronomy literature to back up and
document my previous assertion (that most astronomers, back in the days, agreed at least upon one thing: that the Moon’s motions _gravely contradicted_ Newton’s gravitational laws). Here’s an extract from the book “Pierre-Simon Laplace, 1749-1827: A Life in Exact Science”, by Charles Coulston Gillispie (1997):

And here’s an extract from the “Edinburgh Review or Critical Journal”, again highlighting the fact that the Moon’s observed motions (what with its so-called “anomalies and inequalities”) were in stark contradiction with Newton’s gravitational theories:

The problems with the Moon’s motions ranged from its observed periodic (short-term) motions and all the way to its secular (long-term) motions over the centuries. The latter triggered a gigantic (and still unsettled) debate as studies of the ancient solar/lunar eclipses suggested that over time the Moon was continually “accelerating”, although - paradoxically enough - its orbital speed was thought to be decreasing. Other theories proposed that Earth’s rotation was actually decelerating. In short, and to put it bluntly - it was all a big mess.

> _“Astronomers who studied the timing of eclipses over many centuries found that the Moon seemed to be accelerating in its orbit, but what was actually happening was that the Earth’s rotation was slowing down. The effect was first noticed by Edmund Halley in 1695, and first measured by Richard Dunthorne in 1748, though **neither one really understood what they were seeing**.”_

In short, the time has come to clear up the messy house - and I am happy to take on the task. I shall start with these supposed secular “accelerations” of the Moon and demonstrate how the TYCHOS can account for them in the simplest imaginable manner. My two below graphics should suffice to illustrate the matter in easily comprehensible fashion.

### The TYCHOS - and the Moon's apparent secular acceleration

My below diagram illustrates how and why the Moon will _appear_ to accelerate over the centuries, yet it is only an illusion caused by the geometry / configuration of our Solar System, as expounded in my TYCHOS model - what with the Earth-Moon system circling around the PVP orbit:
