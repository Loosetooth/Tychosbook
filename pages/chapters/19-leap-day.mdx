
Chapter 19: Our “Leap Day”: what is it for?
=========================================================================


You may have asked yourself at some stage in your life, “How can our calendar possibly have an **integer** value of 365 days (or 366 days on a leap year) whereas, on the other hand, we are told that one year lasts ca. 365.25 days (i.e. 365 days + 6 hours?)”

Does this mean that, from one year to the next, Earth ends up skewed by 1/4 of a rotation, or 90°?

Of course not. Yet, everyone knows that we add 1 day every 4 years in order to get a 4-year-sequence of 365 + 365 + 365 + 366 = 1461/4 = 365.25 (or more precisely, 365.2425 - as defined by the Gregorian calendar - as some leap years are being periodically skipped). Here are some 'explanations' for the 4-year occurrence of February 29: “[February 29](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_February_29.pdf)” from Wikipedia.

> _“In the Gregorian calendar, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100, 2200, and 2300. Conversely, 1600 and 2000 did and 2400 will.”_

My below sequence shows ad absurdum the implication of the well-known notion that “a year actually lasts for 365.**25** days”.

Obviously, we do not end up skewed by 6 hours at the completion of a year. Thus, we may legitimately ask ourselves:_“Where do these 6 hours come from?”_ Can the Copernican model account for them, and can the reason for their existence be visually illustrated in a heliocentric graphic? The short answer to this last question is: No.

On the other hand, the TYCHOS model can illustrate the probable motive for astronomers to have stipulated that a year lasts for about 6 hours (or ¼ of a day) more than 365 integer days.

Astronomers have observed over the centuries that the **maximal** annual displacement of a given star on the ecliptic (currently 50.29” arcseconds per year) occurs between point “A” and point “B” (as marked in my above graphic). So, every year, 6 hours are considered to be “lost in space”. Therefore, they have concluded that _“one sidereal year lasts for 365.25 days”_ (or more precisely 365.25636 days).

However, we may also read in the Wikipedia’s entry on the [“Sothic cycle”](https://www.tychos.info/citation/_WIKIP-Feb-2017_Sothic_cycle.pdf):

> “The Sidereal year of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the ecliptic (the apparent path of the sun across the sky).”

Every civil year (of 365.0 days), we see the Sun “slipping backwards” against the starry background by about 1 minute (of RA). Every four years, this adds up to about 4 minutes (of RA) of “lost ground” on the part of the Sun. 4 minutes is just about the same amount of RA that the Sun advances by each day (more precisely, 3.93 minutes). Therefore, by (the Gregorian calendar’s) convention, one extra "leap" day, February 29, is added to make up for the Sun’s lost ground.

Let's do some simple maths: 

In 4 years, Earth moves along its PVP orbit (according to the TYCHOS) by 14035.85km X 4 = 56143.4km

This distance (which will 'offset the Earth-Sun alignment with the stars') will correspond to a 'slice' of the Sun's orbit (which is 2.6423X larger than Earth's PVP orbit) of:

56143.4km X 2.6423 = 148347.7km 

This distance of 148347.7km represents about 83 minutes of the Sun's motion (as it travels at 107.226km/h): 

148347.7km ÷ 107226km/h = 1.3835hours - or 83.01 minutes

In 4 years of 365.2425 days (or 525949.2min), there are: 525949.2min X 4 = 2103796.8min

We see that 83.01min equals **0.0039457%** of 2103796.8min

Now, where have we seen that **0.0039457%** value before? Well, we saw it in Chapter 12, where we found that it represents the rate of the annual motions of the Sun and Earth around their respective orbits. Hence, the leap year is simply a clever way of ideally "resetting" the Earth-Sun alignment - which is constantly "upset" due to the Sun and Earth moving in opposed spatial directions.      

In short, the reason why we cannot divide our solar year in 365 integer days is due to Earth's 1-mph-motion around its PVP orbit.

**The Tychosium simulator's secular accuracy**

Before we proceed to the next Chapter ("Understanding the TYCHOS' Great Year"), this may be a good time to address the following question:

_"Does the Tychosium 3D simulator agree with other (Copernican) Solar System simulators - over longer periods of time?"_

The answer to this question is 'yes and no'. The simple reason being that the various available Solar System simulators all (slightly) disagree with each other. However, there is one particular simulator (the "JS Orrery") that is of particular interest to the Tychos model, because its graphic construct / layout is very similar to that of the Tychosium 3D simulator. Moreover, the man credited with providing the exacting ephemeride tables (i.e. the secular planetary positions) for the JS Orrery is none other than [Paul Schlyter](http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html), a world-renowned veteran Swedish astronomer who - a few years ago - spent several months corresponding via e-mail with yours truly and Patrik Holmqvist (the computer-programmer of the Tychosium 3D simulator - and my closest collaborator). To make a long story short, Paul Schlyter was adamant that the Tychos model was utter poppycock - and that any simulator of the same was doomed to failure. At the time, the Tychosium 3D simulator was in its early stages of development; Schlyter was quick to jump on its imperfections and, after a few months of (the rather aggressive sort of) dismissive critique, Schlyter ended up abandoning the debate, lamenting that it was "wasting his time".      

Well, a few days ago (early March 2022), I went back to the JS Orrery and compared its secular planetary motions with those of the now perfected Tychosium 3D simulator.

The below two screenshots (from the Tychosium and the JS Orrery) show the relative positions of the Sun, Mars, Earth, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter **on June 21, 1915** - in both simulators:

The below two screenshots (from the Tychosium and the JS Orrery) show the relative positions of the Sun, Mars, Earth, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter **on June 21, 25344** - in both simulators:

As you can see, the two simulators remain in most excellent agreement - over a time span of _more than 23 thousand years!_ Patrik Holmqvist and I are now satisfied that we have not been wasting our own time; the Tychosium 3D machine is now at least as reliable (in predicting secular planetary positions) as any of the best heliocentric Solar System simulators.
