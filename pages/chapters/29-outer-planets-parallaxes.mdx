What follows is the tale of my most cherished encounter during the course of my ardent Tychos research adventure: that with the tiny planet (or, if you will, near-earth asteroid/NEA), Eros. As we shall see, not only does Eros strenghten the Tychos model’s tenets; it also provides the strongest disproval of the heliocentric theory's 'explanation' for the periodic retrograde motions of our planets. Firstly though, a brief summary of yesterday’s astronomers’ feverish quest to measure the Earth-Sun distance is in order.

There was enormous excitement among the late 19th-century astronomers as Eros was discovered on 13 August 1898. In the previous decades, humongous efforts had been invested in determining the all-important Earth-Sun distance. For example, only for the sake of observing [Venus’ 1874 transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1874_transit_of_Venus) across the solar disk, France, England and the US had organized as many as 19 official expeditions around the world, some of which cost the lives of several sailors and astronomers.

Why all these frantic and titanic efforts, you may ask? Well, since Venus is the (largest) celestial body that transits closest to Earth, the idea was to measure its parallax vis-à-vis the Sun, and thus to finally determine the exact Earth>Sun distance. In fact, both the close-passing Mars and Venus had been used for this purpose, yet there were ongoing controversies as to the accuracy of these observations. This is described in an essay by Edmund Ledger titled **“The New Planet Eros”**, published in 1900:

> _"“It was at one time hoped that this (the Earth-Sun distance) might be accurately determined in the case of Venus by observations made on those rare occasions when it passes in transit across the sun’s disk. But the glare of the sun’s light, the ill-defined edge of the sun’s disk, and the atmosphere of Venus itself, combine to deprive such observations of the necessary accuracy. Apart from some other methods, involving long periods of time and highly complicated theoretical investigations in their use, attention was therefore next given to an attempt to obtain the distance of the planet Mars when it makes its nearest approaches to the earth. It was, however, found to be difficult to measure the exact position of the centre of its disk.”_

Enter Eros. When Eros was discovered by German astronomer Carl Gustav Witt at the Berlin Observatory on 13 August 1898, it was soon realized that it would pass _much closer_ to Earth than either Mars or Venus. Edmund Ledger wrote:

>_“But in the case of Eros we meet with something utterly different and unexpected. A new planet has been discovered whose average distance from the sun is less than that of Mars; a planet which at times comes within a distance from the earth not much more than one third of the nearest distance within which Mars ever approaches it.”_[Essays in Astronomy - by Edmund Ledger](https://archive.org/details/essaysinastronom00newyrich/page/238/mode/2up)

Today, Eros’ closest passages to Earth (~0.17 AU) are estimated to be roughly 2 and 3 times closer than the closest passages of Venus (~0.3 AU) and Mars (~0.45 AU), respectively. Eros is the largest member of a group of NEAs referred to as [‘the Amor asteroids’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_asteroid). In Latin, ‘amor’ means ‘love’, and ‘Eros’ was the Greek God of love. Why this peculiar nomenclature is interesting will soon become clear. 

As I studied the available data of Eros so as to integrate it into the Tychosium simulator, I noticed that Eros’ closest near-Earth passages occur almost precisely every 81 years (around 31 January) at virtually the same place in our sky (note that this is somewhat reminiscent of Mars’ 79-year cycle). Having gathered the known parameters of Eros (i.e. orbital size, speed, ephemerides, closest passages to Earth), I activated the Tychosium simulator's ‘Trace’ function for Eros and pushed ‘Play’. That’s when my jaw dropped. I think you can imagine me gasping in utter fascination at the shape traced by Eros’ ‘spirographic’ orbit around our Solar System...

That’s right, ladies and gentlemen: Eros - named after the Greek God of LOVE - traces a _heart_ around Earth!

I then proceeded to adjust (within the Tychosium simulator) some of Eros’ closest Earth passages by perusing the data at the JPL/NASA website. Within a few hours of toggling, I was pleased to see that ‘my TYCHOS Eros’ was in excellent agreement with the JPL/NASA ephemeride tables for Eros! Here’s a back-to-back comparison between the JPL and the Tychosium ephemerides of five super-close passages of Eros (1850, 1931, 2012, 2093, 2174). They make for a most spectacular match.

At this point, you will probably be curious as to how this extraordinary agreement between the JPL and the TYCHOS ephemerides of Eros will look like, as viewed in the respective JPL/NASA and Tychosium solar system simulators. My below diagram compares the latest super-close passage of Eros (January 31, 2012) - as depicted in the two simulators:

I would now like to encourage the inquisitive readers to verify this for themselves: go to the [Tychosium 3D simulator](https://codepen.io/pholmq/full/XGPrPd) and activate Eros' orbit (by checking the Eros box in the 'Planets' menu). You may then open the [orbit viewer for Eros](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=eros&view=VOP) at the JPL/NASA website - and start comparing the orbital motions of Eros in the two simulators.     

### EROS DISPROVES THE HELIOCENTRIC "EXPLANATION" FOR OUR PLANETS' RETROGRADE MOTIONS

We shall now look at the most peculiar aspect of Eros’ observed behavior in the skies: it is a true 'mystery of astronomy' that Eros is hardly ever observed to retrograde (i.e. to reverse direction), unlike all the other planets of our Solar System.

> _“Unlike most objects in the solar system, Eros never appears to be retrograde (back-track across the sky).”_
[Eros - Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros)

The above statement from Wikipedia is not quite true. As Eros passes closest to Earth, it will indeed back-track a tiny bit (by a mere ~20 min of RA on average - and sometimes as little as 5min of RA). Now, remember: the Copernican model’s proposed explanation for the periodic retrograde motions of our planets is that, as Earth overtakes Mars (or as Venus overtakes Earth), the planets will appear to back-track (i.e. reverse direction) for several weeks due to a supposed optical parallax illusion **caused by the shifting viewing angle of the planet in relation to the starry background.**

Well, the observed celestial motions of Eros highlight the glaring problem with this explanation: as we saw earlier, Eros transits almost twice closer to Earth than Venus does. Thus, if our planets’ retrograde motions were caused by such angular shifts, this would violate the basic laws of parallax and perspective: if the Copernican explanation for these retrograde motions were true, then the near-Earth asteroid Eros should be observed to retrograde against the starry background by a  _much larger_ amount than Venus! 

As always, a picture speaks more than a thousand words:

Note that the speed differential between Earth (~30 km/s in the Copernican model) and Venus (~35km/s) is virtually identical to the speed differential between Earth (~30 km/s in the Copernican model) and Eros (~25 km/s). In both cases, the speed differential is 5 km/s. Hence, the fact that Eros hardly retrogrades at all remains a total mystery  `
