Chapter 29 — Earth’s 1 mph motion explains all of our “Outer” Planets’ parallaxes
=================================================================================

As every astronomer will know, the orbital periods of our outer or “Jovian” planets from Jupiter to Pluto are all reckoned to be slightly shorter than a whole integer number of solar years. Jupiter, for instance, is said to complete one of its orbits in 11.862 years. Saturn is said to complete one of its orbits in 29.4571 years.

Likewise, the rest of our outer planets are said to complete their orbits in just a trifle less than “X” integer years. The TYCHOS model can conclusively demonstrate that, in reality, all of our outer (or “P-Type”) planets actually return to the same place in space in an **exact integer number** of solar years. The illusion was caused, yet again, by Earth’s 1 mph motion; as we move around our PVP orbit, we will naturally “meet up” with these planets (as viewed against the starry background) slightly earlier than the completion of their true orbital periods.

The actual orbital periods of our clock-like system are:

PLANET

YEARS

Jupiter

12

Saturn

30

Uranus

84

Neptune

165

Pluto

248

#### Jupiter

Let’s start with Jupiter and see if we can find out just why it appears to complete one orbit in slightly less than 12 integer years. As observed from Earth, Jupiter appears to orbit once every 11.862 years (or 4332.6 days) or about **1.15%** less than 12 years.

In the TYCHOS model, Jupiter’s true orbital period is 4383 days. The gap between 4383 days (12.0 years) and 4332.6 days (11.862 years) is 50.4 days or 1209.6 hours. What will have taken place in 1209.6 hours to create the illusion? Let’s see: in 1209.6 hours, Earth will cover:

1209.6 hours X 1.601169 km/h ≈ 1936.77 km

As it is, 1936.77 km ≈ **1.15%** of 168,430 km

168,430 km is about the distance that Earth covers in 12 years, clearly indicating that the reason why we see Jupiter “offset” by 1.15% vis-à-vis the Sun (after 12 years) is due to the parallax effect generated by Earth’s motion.

Note that Jupiter’s orbit is 13.7519 X larger than Earth’s PVP orbit. Hence, every Jovian orbit, we should expect Jupiter to be radially offset by the following amount:

168,430 km (Earth’s motion in 12 years) X 13.752 = 2,316,249.36 km

This is 0.0473484667 % of Jupiter’s orbital circumference of 4,891,895,452.6 km. We may ideally call this percentage value the “Earth-Jupiter parallax rate”.

As it is, **0.047348 %** of 1,296,000 arc seconds gives us 613.63 arc seconds. If we now divide this value by 12 years we obtain, lo and behold:

613.63 / 12 ≈ **51.136”**

Hopefully you recognize by now the TYCHOS-computed ACP.

**In conclusion**  
Jupiter truly revolves once every 12 (integer) solar years. The observed “offset” is caused by Earth’s 1-mph motion.

#### Saturn

As observed from Earth, Saturn appears to orbit once every 29.4571 years or 10759 days – about **1.81%** less than 30 years.

In the TYCHOS model, Saturn’s true orbital period is 30(.0) solar years or 10,957.5 days. The gap between 10,957.5 days (30.0 years) and 10759 days (29.4571 years) is 198.5 days or 4764 hours.

Once again, in 4764 hours, Earth will cover:

4764 X 1.601169 km ≈ 7628 km

That’s **1.81%** of 421,075 km

421,075 km is the distance that Earth covers in 30 years, clearly indicating that the reason why we see Saturn “offset” by 1.81% vis-à-vis the Sun (after 30 years) is due to the parallax effect caused by Earth’s 1-mph motion.

Note that Saturn’s orbit is 25.2 X larger than Earth’s PVP orbit. Hence, every 30 years we should expect Saturn to be “radially” offset by the following amount

421,075 km (the distance that Earth covers in 30 years) X 25.2 = 10,611,090 km

This is right around 0.11837% of Saturn’s orbital circumference of 8,964,009,501 km. We may ideally call this percentage value the “Earth-Saturn parallax rate”.

As it is, **0.1183712%** of 1,296,000 arc seconds equals 1534.09 arc seconds. If we now divide this value by 30 years, we once more obtain our good ‘ol ACP:

1534.09 / 30 = **51.136”**

**In conclusion**  
Saturn truly revolves once every 30 (integer) solar years. The observed “offset” is caused by Earth’s 1-mph motion.

Likewise, the three remaining planets of our system (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) can all be shown to appear offset due to Earth’s 1-mph motion. All three of them are currently believed to have orbital periods curiously just a whisker short of an integer number of solar years (much like we just saw with Jupiter and Saturn).

#### Uranus

“Orbital period: 30,589 days” — about 83.74 years, or a trifle less than **84** years

#### Neptune

“Orbital Period: 60,182 days.” — about 164.77 years, or a trifle less than **165** years

#### Pluto

“Orbital Period: 90,560 days.” — about 247.94 years, or a trifle less than **248** years

In reality, the orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are all perfectly synchronized (at integer multiples) with the Sun and with our Moon. In the TYCHOS, their true orbital periods are, respectively, 84, 165 & 248 solar years exactly!

The only reason why they will appear to be slightly “offset” after completing one of their orbits in relation to the stars, is due to the parallax effect for earthly observers. This will presently be demonstrated by my next three graphics which feature screenshots (at intervals of 84, 165 and 248 years) taken from the NEAVE online planetarium.

It is essential to fully understand what is meant by “the exact same place”. Yes, this means that these planets return to the same location in space within the said time intervals.

### Uranus — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period: exactly 84 Solar Years, or 30,681 days – **exactly** 1050 X 29.22 days (“Moon TMSP’s”).

In 84 years, Earth moves by 14035.847 km X 84 ≈ 1,179,011 km (0.3314% of the PVP orbit circumference of 355,724,597 km). Now, 0.3314% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min. = 4.77216 min. of RA.

In fact, the NEAVE planetarium shows us a close match:

Between Oct 15, 2016 and Oct 15, 2100 (84 years), Uranus returns to the same celestial longitude (RA) + circa 4.4 min. of RA!

Note that the Earth-Uranus parallax rate (0.3314%) is ca. 2.8 X larger than the Earth-Saturn parallax rate (0.11837%).

This reflects the fact that Uranus’s revolution period of 84 years is 2.8 X longer than Saturn’s revolution period of 30 years.

### Neptune — in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period: exactly 165 Solar Years, or 60,266.25 days – **exactly** 2062.5 x 29.22 days (“Moon TMSP’s”).

In 165 years, Earth moves by 14035.847 km X 165 ≈ 2,315,915 km (0.651% of the PVP orbit circumference of 355,724,597 km). Now, 0.651% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min. ≈ 9.375 min. of RA — and in fact, the NEAVE planetarium shows us a close match.

Between Sept 5, 2017 and Sept 5, 2182 (165 years) Neptune returns to the same celestial longitude (RA) + circa 10 min. of RA!

Note that the Earth-Neptune parallax (9.375 min.) is ca. 1.965 X larger than the Earth-Uranus parallax (4.77216 min.).

This reflects the fact that Neptune’s revolution period of 165 years is ca. 1.965 X longer than Uranus’s revolution period of 84 years.

![](https://www.tychos.info/book_imagery/116_NEW_PLUTO_parallax_248years_01.jpg)

### Pluto in the TYCHOS:

Orbital period: exactly 248 Solar Years, or 90,582 days – **exactly** 3100 X 29.22 days (“Moon TMSP’s”).

In 248 years, Earth moves by 14035.847 km X 248 ≈ 3,480,890 km (0.978535% of the PVP orbit circumference of 355,724,597 km). Now, 0.978535% of our full, 360° celestial sphere of 1440 min. ≈ 14 min. of RA — again, the NEAVE planetarium gives us another (near) match:

Between Oct 28, 1941 and Oct 28, 2189 (248 years), Pluto returns to the same celestial longitude (RA) + circa 12 min. of RA.\*

Note that the (expected) Earth-Pluto parallax (14 min.) is ca. 1.5 X larger than the Earth-Neptune parallax (9.3744 min.).

This reflects the fact that Pluto’s revolution period of 248 years is ca. 1.5 X longer than Neptune’s revolution period of 165 years.

\* NOTE: The reason why Pluto, with its almost 250-year-long period, is observed to be advancing by only 12 min. — that is, two minutes less than the expected 14 min. — should become apparent in [Chapter 31](https://www.tychos.info/chapter-31/), where I will be expounding how the peculiar Gregorian calendar-count sloppily attempts to contain the secular precession of our solar system.

In conclusion, the true values of the orbital periods of every planet are in actuality, integer multiples of the orbital periods of our Sun (and of our Moon). All of their apparent “lateral offsets” with the background stars can be shown to be directly caused by Earth’s 1-mph motion through the ACP around its PVP orbit.

In the light of this, we have proven that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are in the category that modern-day astrophysicists currently refer to as **“P-Type”** planets (_a.k.a._ circumbinary celestial bodies) as illustrated in [Chapter 8](https://www.tychos.info/chapter-8/).
