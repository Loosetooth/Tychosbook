Chapter 21 - A Man's Yearly Path - and the Analemma
==========================================================

In the TYCHOS, Earth proceeds at 1.6km/h(or ≈1mph), covering an annual distance of ca. 14036km. You will note that this distance is just a little longer (by 1280km) than Earth's own diameter of 12756km. Since Earth also spins around its axis every 24 hours or so, it follows that the path traced by a man (standing still for a full year) will be a [trochoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochoid). A trochoid is simply a curve traced by a point fixed to a circle as it rolls along a straight line. So if we imagine a stationary man in London (let's call him "Jim") looking through his telescope for a full year, our Jim will be carried around a trochoidal path (Jim is patiently monitoring the annual motions of the star Vega).

Of course, unless Jim is aware of his own trochoidal motion, he will be baffled and stupefied at star Vega's seemingly 'inexplicable' behavior. Since Jim is a Copernican astronomer who believes that Earth revolves around the Sun, he simply cannot reconcile his observations with his pre-conceived world view. Jim then decides to monitor another star, then another - and then another. He finally realizes that ALL the stars in our sky exhibit trochoidal motions!    

Here is a modern diagram of the observed motions of the star Vega:

Jim, who just isn't ready to abandon his long-nurtured convictions, may then come up with all sorts of theories to 'explain the unexplainable'. This was, in fact, precisely the case with Astronomer Royal James Bradley who famously monitored the star Draconis for extended periods of time and, having later noticed that ALL the stars actually exhibit similar annual trochoidal paths, went on to formulate an abstruse theory that he named "Stellar Aberration" - or "the Aberration of Light"... But more about that later.

The below image is from an astronomy website. It shows that even our nearmost star, Proxima Centauri, is observed to proceed around a trochoidal path. Remarkably though, this motion is officially claimed to be _“the result of the Earth’s motion around the Sun”_!

We shall now proceed to show how this annual trochoidal motion (of any earthly observer) can account for other still unexplained - or dubiously explained - celestial phenomena. Perhaps the most curious of them all is the observed annual motion of the Sun – as it traces an elongated “8”-shaped pattern in our skies. This geometric pattern traced by the Sun is known as the “Analemma”.


### THE ANALEMMA -  a qualitative analysis 

Any patient photographer can empirically verify the existence of the Analemma by setting up a tripod and snapping pictures of the Sun at noon (say, every ten days or so) for a full year. What will be obtained is a vertically-elongated, “8”-shaped pattern (wider at the lower end) well-known to astronomers. 

Everyone has heard of the proverbial broken clock “which will nonetheless show the correct time twice a day”. However, not everyone knows that our earthly clocks are, strictly speaking, almost never on time. In fact, our clocks only agree with the Sun’s midday zenith 4 times a year. The remaining part of the year, our clocks will drunkenly be slipping in-and-out of sync with the Sun by as many as +16 minutes or -14 minutes, depending on the season / time of year!

What exactly causes this curious analemma phenomenon? Of course, the vertical component (December-June) of the analemma is due to the Sun’s shifting elevation between winter and summer (23.4°X 2 = 46.8°) caused by Earth's 23.4°-degree axial tilt — so no mystery there.

On the other hand, the _lateral_ component of the analemma (i.e.; the alternating east/west drift of the Sun) has not, to this day, been adequately explained in any satisfactory manner. As Keplerian theory has it, it is caused by Earth _"accelerating or decelerating around its slightly elliptical orbit”(*)._ This, we are told, would account for the Sun’s zenith to oscillate in our skies by more than 30 minutes. What sort of magical forces would cause Earth to speed up and slow down is unclear. Here on Earth, there is simply no such physical phenomenon to be observed in nature. Yet, this has somehow been accepted as a scientific fact in absence of any experimental corroboration. 

**(*)NOTE: In any event, this Keplerian theory is directly contradicted by the fact that the Sun's motion (or rather 'Earth's motion' - under the heliocentric paradigm) appears to _accelerate_ in June & July, i.e. when Earth's velocity, according to Newton's laws, would be at its MINIMUM - as it transits at its furthest distance from the Sun.**

Another curious aspect of the Analemma is its asymmetric 8-shape (thinner at the top and thicker at the bottom). What scould possibly cause this uneven 'distribution' of the Sun's annual East-West oscillation? Various theories have been advanced - yet none have definitively settled the question. However, as we consider a "Man's yearly path" (see above), we see that the trochoidal motion of an earthly observer (over a full year) has a lateral displacement ratio of 3:1. And in fact, the asymmetry of the Analemma also exhibits a similar 3:1 ratio; I trust that my below diagram should instantly clarify this matter.
