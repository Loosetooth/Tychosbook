At this point, I will venture to say that the TYCHOS model is more than just another alternative cosmic theory. It is the current best explanation for every observed geometric phenomenon of the cosmos. I am satisfied that it represents the most solid interpretation of the vast body of astronomical observations available to mankind today. These observations, gathered tirelessly over the centuries by admirably diligent and hard-working individuals, constitute the very foundation around which the TYCHOS model has woven its logical conclusions. All I have done is to assemble the many pieces of a gigantic puzzle which were already there for everyone to see. My infinite gratitude goes to all these patient souls who have dedicated their lives to the noble cause of understanding our surrounding cosmos. To name them all would be unrealistic, so let me just symbolically tip my hat to Tycho Brahe whose widely snubbed, sidelined and even ridiculed observational work is now well and truly vindicated.
