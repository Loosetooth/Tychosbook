Introduction for the Online Edition
===================================
The TYCHOS book is the result of almost half a decade of steady research into mostly non-Copernican astronomical literature, data and teachings. It all started as a personal quest to probe a number of issues and incongruities which, in my mind, afflicted Copernicus’ famed (and almost universally-accepted) heliocentric theory.

As I gradually came to realize that the Copernican / Keplerian model presented truly insurmountable problems as to its proposed physics and geometry, I decided to put to the test, in methodical fashion, what was once its most formidable adversary, namely the geo-heliocentric Tychonic model devised by the great observational astronomer Tycho Brahe. In short, the essential soundness of Tycho’s original model led me to envision and formulate the missing pieces of his ingenious (yet incomplete) configuration of our solar system.

The TYCHOS book expounds in simple narrative style – and with the visual support of more than 100 original illustrations – my revised design of Brahe’s system which, in absence of any other working model, should be ideally implemented in all branches of astronomy and astrophysics. This, because the TYCHOS is today the only existing model of our solar system which agrees – by and large – with the vast body of empirical astronomical observations aquired and documented by humankind throughout the centuries. In any event, as clearly demonstrated in my book, the Copernican model is fundamentally flawed – and needs to be definitively discarded.

UPDATE \[March 2020\]: My TYCHOS book (all 36 chapters) is now freely accessible online – in the interest of maximum divulgation. However, I will warmly appreciate any financial support / donation towards my longstanding and ongoing research efforts (see donate button at the bottom of this page). Since 2013, I have independently pursued and developed the Tychos model without any sort of institutional funding – and am currently working on the 2nd edition of the book. Here is where you may purchase the original 1st edition of my book, “The TYCHOS – Our Geoaxial Binary System”-(2018) in [physical form](https://www.tychos.info/purchase-the-book/).

As you read the book, make sure to visit and peruse the [Tychosium 3-D](https://codepen.io/pholmq/full/XGPrPd), an interactive digital planetarium in constant development (with my research partner and computer programmer Patrik Holmqvist) which already simulates the Tychos Solar System to a high level of accuracy.

Thank you – and enjoy your newfound cosmic perspective. Consider it, if you will, as a boon empowering your intellectual awareness during your life on this planet. It may well take many years (or decades?) before the TYCHOS model will be acknowledged, discussed, let alone accepted by this world’s scientific community. However, I trust that the plain soundness of its principles will ultimately shine through.

May reason prevail.
