The author of this book - Simon Shack, is an honest and intelligent man. Unfortunatley we live in an age where these two traits combined are rarely rewarded. Simon Shack has devoted more than a decade of his life to discover, examine and expose mass deception. You will find more of his work at [cluesforum.info](http://cluesforum.info/).

When I was offered to read the draft of this book 2018, I was sceptical to say the least. How could something as accepted as the current Solar system model be wrong!? But since I knew that Simon Shack had been right about many other things I intitially thought to be wrong, I started reading. And allthough I honestly could not grasp much of it at the time it made sense so I wanted to examine it further. And since I am a software developer I offered Simon my help with doing simulations of his suggested model. This is what later become Tychosium 3D - The first simulation of our Solar System that is in accordance with geometry and the laws of physics. But I must admit that I didn't think this would be the outcome at the time. I figured that somewhere along the road a problem with this model would surface. But it's has actually been the exact opposite. On every step observations, experiments and demonstrations has confirmed the TYCHOS. It is actually very hard for me to understand today how the current Solar system model has been able to surive for all this time. The main explanation for this I'd say is mind control. By means of mass deception, common people as well as proficient asatronomers has been made unable to ask this question. And if someone has dared to do so despite all the deception surrounding it
