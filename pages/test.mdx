==============

The relatively recent realization that our visible stars have a smaller (and oft invisible) companion is the single most significant, paradigm-changing astronomical epiphany of our modern age. Today, astronomers are incessantly discovering new binary systems at an ever-increasing rate. One can only wonder why such persistent findings haven’t yet sparked a major debate as to the validity of the Copernican model and its unique, “one-of-a-kind” configuration.


### The intersecting orbits of Sun and Mars : a typical binary system

IMPORTANT NOTE: the above graphic is meant to be a “3/4 view” of our system – as if we were approaching our solar system in an imaginary spaceship at an angle, roughly at 45° above the “March / December” side. Thus, the apparent elliptical shapes of the Sun / Mars orbits are only a matter of perspective. In the TYCHOS model, ALL the orbits of our system’s bodies are uniformly circular.

Note that, in my above graphic, Earth is still lacking an orbit of its own. Yet, we shall see about how I overcame that age-old obstacle in due time. Please know that I have earnestly strived to do my best to document a progressive, step-by-step account of my thought processes, as the TYCHOS model gradually took shape in my mind. I fully realize the initial difficulty to take in and visualize this new configuration of our so-called Solar System – given, perhaps, the novelty of it all. However, I hope that by proceeding in short, descriptive sections it will be easier for everyone to follow the methodological path which led me to formulate the TYCHOS model and to arrive at its logical conclusions.

Let us begin with a classic binary star system, as illustrated on the website previously referenced in [Chapter 1](https://www.tychos.info/citation/007B_Binary-Stars.htm).

Notice that, if we substitute the above “high mass star” and “low mass star” with the SUN and MARS respectively (as I have done in the below adaptation) we obtain a neatly-balanced binary system that incorporates the two moons of the Sun (Mercury and Venus) and the two moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos).

In addition, please separately observe the additional “plot twist” of paramount interest to us Earthlings:

### In the TYCHOS, Earth is positioned near the center of mass (or barycenter) of the Sun-Mars binary system.

We can see just how harmonious such a binary system would be: Earth embraced by the Sun-Mars binary duo, each with their own two satellites. Now, if you are trained to think Relativistically, you might wonder: “But what about the highly unequal masses of the Sun and Mars?”

Note that binary star systems, as numerous as they are, pose a serious problem for Einstein’s theory of general relativity.

> “If the general relativity method is correct, it ought to apply everywhere, not just in the solar system. But Van Flandern points to a conflict outside it: binary stars with highly unequal masses. Their orbits behave in ways that the Einstein formula did not predict. ‘Physicists know about it and shrug their shoulders,’ Van Flandern says. They say there must be ‘something peculiar about these stars, such as an oblateness, or tidal effects.’ Another possibility is that Einstein saw to it that he got the result needed to ‘explain’ Mercury’s orbit, but that it doesn’t apply elsewhere.”

We shall soon see that the highly unequal sizes of, for instance, Sirius A and Sirius B, are just as unequal as the Sun and Mars.


In the TYCHOS model, Mercury and Venus are the Sun’s two tidally-locked moons, much as Mars also has two (lesser-known) tidally-locked moons: Phobos and Deimos, which were only discovered as recently as 1877 by Asaph Hall. (Tycho Brahe never observed them).
